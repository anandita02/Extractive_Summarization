" it 's important that , given the fluidness of the situation on the ground , that the @entity6 work to ensure that it takes the right kinds of actions , such as an investigation into the death , and sends a clear and transparent message that they speak on behalf of the @entity4 opposition and the @entity4 people and that they are diligently carrying out their mandate			1
" the @entity6 has been rocked by internal divisions , with rival rebel groups battling each other			1

the move , done in coordination with the international community , paves the way for the @entity9 to reopen the embassy , accredit diplomats and unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen assets			0
the internal strife within the rebel movement comes as the @entity2 prepares to hand over the @entity4 embassy to the @entity6 as the recognized government of @entity4 , according to @entity9 officials			1
the officials say the move would allow the @entity6 to re-open the embassy , accredit diplomats and regain control of the embassy 's frozen bank account , worth about $ 13 million			2
it follows a formal request from the @entity6 to re-open the embassy under its control and accredit @entity76 , the former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity9 , as its charge d'affaires			1
in march , the @entity2 ordered the @entity4 embassy in @entity0 closed and kicked diplomats loyal to @entity4 leader @entity80 out of the country			1

" this is an extremely challenging period for @entity4 and they are dealing with these challenges as they come			0
but we have confidence that they can weather this			0
" but privately , @entity9 officials acknowledge there is some concern about the apparent disarray within the rebel movement , although officials say it is not surprising			0
" this is a tribal society , " one official said			0
" we knew from the start this could be messy and there was always the concern about not moving too fast			0
we had no illusions about the @entity6 , but they have done a pretty good job and look better to us than @entity80 at this point			2
" @entity122 has been bombing @entity4 for more than four months under a @entity124 mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to @entity80 , who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country			1
the @entity9 @entity131 in @entity132 was shuttered and @entity9 personnel evacuated by sea and air in late february , after the current revolt against @entity80 erupted			2
@entity4 and @entity9 officials held face - to - face talks in @entity139 last month , but @entity0 says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that @entity80 " must go			1
