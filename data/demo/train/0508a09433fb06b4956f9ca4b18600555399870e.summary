-- children play with a worn - out badminton set			1
families sip traditional @entity5 tea known as chai from silver - colored cups and chat as the sun sets in a rose - colored sky			1
goats bleat in the distance , water buffaloes chew on hay and the cackles of crows ring through the air			1
welcome to the village of @entity18 , in southeast @entity5 , not far from the @entity19			1
here , lush green rice paddies ring concrete homes in various stages of construction			1
i came here with 15 colleagues to help these villagers , who are among some of @entity5 's poorest and most disadvantaged people			1
we came to help build safe and solid concrete and brick homes for them			1
the villagers are @entity36 -- once known as untouchables -- and they still suffer from discrimination			1
this group of 90 families live in thatched - roof huts that are prone to leaks and have mud floors that wash away			1
some of their children attend a " school " that is a small outdoor space in front of a church			2
many only have the clothes on their backs for daily wear			2
@entity53 , head of the @entity54 ( which partners with @entity56 nongovernmental organization @entity55 , the group we used to volunteer in @entity5 ) and our leader on this project , told us that giving the villagers these homes would not only physically improve their lives but it would also boost their morale -- endowing them with a new sense of pride and helping them to dream of a brighter future			1
despite their tough lives -- many of the village men can only get work a few months a year on the rice paddies -- the villagers were enthusiastic , generous and hard - working			2
we worked under humid skies and sunny days , sometimes in more than 40 - degree @entity79 ( 104 degrees @entity80 ) temperatures			2
we carted cement , sifted materials , mixed cement , plastered walls -- and one day we worked together as a group to plaster a roof			1
it was back - breaking work , and watching the villagers tirelessly do it inspired me to do as much as i physically could , though we had to drink copious amounts of water and eat a lot of food			2
i became known as the " after lunch napper , " frazzled by the morning 's duties			2
as we worked side by side with the villagers , we got to know them and their friends			2
one family i spent a lot of time with was building their home to accommodate four generations : their parents , their children and their grandchild			0
their names were @entity114 ( the grandfather ) , his son - in - law @entity116 and his daughter , @entity117			0
@entity116 and @entity117 's eldest daughter had polio , which led to her legs being amputated			0
the couple help raise their daughter 's grandchild , a 5 - year - old boy named @entity125 , who has a clever smile and always seemed ready to test the commands of his grandparents			0
i visited them in their hut , where they lived in a space that seemed to measure about 10 feet by 10 feet			0
i knew the new home -- at a cost of just $ 1,500 -- would dramatically change their lives			0
despite the difficulty of their situation , they kept telling our project leader @entity53 that i was working too hard and needed to rest			0
they always brought us superb chai tea to drink with them			0
but all i wanted was to help them and all the others as much as possible while we were there to get the house done			0
i think we did a good job : though the homes were unfinished when we left after two weeks of work , noticeable progress had been made			0
most importantly , we felt the townspeople 's spirits were lifted			0
during our time , we met many families and played games with the children			1
we asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up			0
one of my colleagues brought bubbles ( which were very popular ) , while others brought clothes , pens and pencils , and sports equipment			0
@entity53 said the villagers benefited by meeting people from outside their world , getting to speak @entity173 and exchange ideas			1
but the benefits were definitely mutual : we got to learn about them , too , their lives , goals and interests			0
these villagers have so many needs : proper schooling , health care , hygiene , clothing , mosquito nets ( which only cost $ 5 ) and , of course , housing			0
but i saw that given the right tools and opportunity , the people of @entity18 were quite capable of accomplishing what they set out to do			1
on our last night , the villagers threw us a party and we danced together in the new saris and kurtas they had given us			0
we all left wondering what we could do next to help them and discussed plans for future work in @entity18 .			1

a group of 16 volunteers from @entity206 goes to @entity5 to help build houses
the people of @entity18 , @entity5 , are some of the poorest people in the country
helping the families was so *rewarding* for @entity213 that she is planning a return trip
