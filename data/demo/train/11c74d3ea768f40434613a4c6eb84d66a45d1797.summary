-- for those following the @entity8 game on television around the world , @entity2 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity3 in the north - eastern city of @entity5 seemed a routine affair			1
@entity2 's latest number 10 , @entity13 , dazzled while scoring one goal and setting up the second in a stadium bedecked with yellow - shirted fans as the hosts continued their serene progress in @entity21 the hosts will match up against @entity23 for top spot in the group table after the @entity23 beat @entity26 4 - 3 , eliminating the @entity26 from semifinal contention			1
the loser of the @entity2 and @entity23 game will likely draw @entity30 in the semifinals			1
at the @entity2 - @entity3 game , not all the action was on the pitch			1
a closer look around the stadium revealed numerous placards railing against corruption , social injustice , high taxes and even some requesting that @entity41 bring hospitals to @entity2 rather than stadiums			2
and outside the @entity46 stadium , newly built at a cost of $ 240 million , it was anything but normal as protesters blocked roads in such numbers they forced a number of vehicles , including some containing @entity41 passengers , to take a different route to the arena			0
@entity2 has been rocked by the biggest demonstrations seen in over two decades this week as protests initially sparked by a hike in bus fares in @entity61 have spiraled into nationwide marches			0
protesters have decried the $ 15 billion being invested in the @entity8 , the @entity64 and the 2016 @entity65 while outlining the need for improvements in hospitals , transportation , education and other key social programs			0
with @entity2 gripped by what is being called the " @entity74 " , it seemed apt that the golden hope for the national team - one who supposedly can bring about a brighter future himself - set the hosts on their way			1
" saddened by all that is occurring in @entity2 , " @entity13 , 21 , wrote in a statement issued before kickoff			1
" i always had faith that it would not be necessary to come to the point of having to take to the streets to demand better conditions for transport , health , education and security			0
all this is the obligation of the government			0
" just hours later , the politically disillusioned @entity13 brought great joy to his 200 million compatriots as he opened the scoring against the @entity97 with a fine volley -- firing home from just inside the box with his left foot , just days after a beauty against @entity26 with his right			2
the ball fell to the new @entity106 signing after a cross from right back @entity109 , who had given his backing to the widespread protests in the run up to the game			2
" @entity115 without violence for a better @entity2 , a peaceful @entity2 , an educated , healthy , honest and happy @entity2 , " he wrote on his @entity114 account			0
while the protestors face an indeterminate wait to see what effect their actions will have , @entity2 's football fans can rest a little easier after the five - time world champions reached the verge of the @entity8 semifinals			0
@entity125 was sealed when @entity13 , who had taken his tally to 13 goals in 15 internationals , shimmied his way between two defenders in stoppage time to set up substitute @entity132 for the second goal			0
despite the protests , the players arrived at the stadium in relaxed mood -- @entity13 tapping away at a tambourine while squad member @entity139 was among several banging a drum			2
@entity2 's victory went some way to redressing their poor run against @entity3 , who boast a better recent record against their opponents than any other side in the world - with six wins from 11 meetings			1
but @entity3 , who won the @entity154 when beating the @entity155 4 - 3 on home soil and took @entity65 gold when defeating the @entity158 at @entity159 , could not find a way past a defense that looked ragged at times			0
having beaten @entity26 3 - 0 in their opener on saturday , @entity2 have maximum from two games -- with their final group a clash coming against @entity23 on saturday in @entity168 .			1

@entity13 scores one and makes the other as hosts @entity2 beat @entity3 2 - 0 in @entity21
@entity23 defeat @entity26 in an epic , to meet hosts in competition for top group spot
build - up to @entity2 match in @entity5 *overshadowed* by widespread protests outside stadium *perimeter*
