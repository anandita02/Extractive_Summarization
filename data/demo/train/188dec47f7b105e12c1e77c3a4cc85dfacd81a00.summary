@entity0 , @entity1 and two other former @entity3 players have filed a lawsuit accusing the @entity3 of misleading them and failing to protect them against on - the - field brain injuries they say caused health problems years after they retired			1
@entity0 and @entity1 , as well as @entity9 and @entity10 , filed the lawsuit wednesday in @entity12 in @entity13 , according to four separate player statements			0
" despite overwhelming medical evidence ... the @entity3 not only failed to take effective action in an attempt to protect players from suffering , but failed to inform players of the true risks associated with concussions , " the statements said			1
the men accused the @entity3 of using a " hand - picked committee of physicians " to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma , particularly concussions , which were later more publicly linked to heightened risks of long - term brain injury			1
" we do believe the @entity3 knew and had that available information with them for many years now , " said attorney @entity32			1
" only recently had they come and acknowledged that concussions and multiple concussions do have this effect			0
" the four men said that since their playing days they 've suffered from a range of symptoms , including headaches , sleeplessness and dementia			2
still , @entity32 acknowledged the difficulty of targeting the @entity3 , particularly when most players voluntarily engaged in similar conduct during their time at the collegiate and high school levels			1
it 's also unclear whether players ' claims can be considered outside their current collective bargaining agreements , and whether the allegations are subject to a statute of limitations , most notable for players like @entity9 , 53 , who played for the @entity59 during the 1970s			2
the league responded thursday to the lawsuit , saying it " has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so			2
" " any allegation that the @entity3 intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit , " the statement added			1
" it stands in contrast to the league 's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions			1
" @entity0 , 32 , played for the @entity78 and the @entity79 , ending his career in 2009			0
@entity1 , 41 , played for the @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83			0
@entity10 , 38 , who played as a safety for the @entity85 , said that since his retirement , he 's experienced frequent headaches , difficulty sleeping and tingling sensations in his arms and hands			0
knowing the risks associated with head trauma " probably would have made me at least play a little bit different , " @entity10 told @entity92			1
" i would have used my head a whole lot less , or not at all , when it came to trying to make plays			2
but i was coached to do that			0
i did what i was coached to do , not knowing the ramifications that i 'd be dealing with today			0
" part of the problem , said former @entity59 linebacker @entity104 , is a sports culture that encourages behavior largely out of step with the now recognized risks associated with head trauma			1
head trauma injuries are exacerbated when coaches , even at the high school level say , " ' oh , you just got your bell rung			1
get back out there and play , ' " said @entity104			0
this can contribute , he added , to the danger of long - term brain damage			2
later on thursday , the @entity119 announced in a statement that it 's " not a party to this lawsuit and has no comment at this time			0
" in recent years , the @entity3 has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field , adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to more independently evaluate injured players			1
in 2005 , the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads , a move commonly referred to as a " horse - collar " tackle , after concluding it commonly resulted in injury			1
it also recently strengthened a 1979 rule that prohibits players from using their helmets to butt , or " spear " players during a tackle -- a rule that critics had often complained lacked official enforcement			0
players like @entity152 ' linebacker @entity151 have since faced hefty and repeated fines for helmet - first tackles			2
still , others have called for added protections following a series of high - profile incidents involving former players ' health			2
in may , scientists announced that an autopsy of the brain of former @entity165 safety @entity164 , 50 , who died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , showed evidence of " moderately advanced " chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity169 , a dementia - like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma			1
@entity169 has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former @entity3 players studied at @entity175 for the @entity176			1
their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both			0
@entity183 , who died in 2008 at the age of 45 , also from a gunshot wound , was the first deceased athlete studied for the disease at the @entity175 center , according to its website			0
" examination of mr. @entity183 's brain confirmed extensive @entity169 , " the website said			0
@entity193 , an offensive lineman with the @entity152 who died at the age of 50 , was also diagnosed posthumously with @entity169			0
scientists at @entity175 say they have found evidence of @entity169 in the brain of an athlete as young as 18 years old .			0
