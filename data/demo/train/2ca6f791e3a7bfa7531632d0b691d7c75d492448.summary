-- it 's not news that the national debt presents a daunting challenge			0
the public debt is growing faster than the economy , a trend that can not be sustained			1
even more immediately , at years ' end we will face a $ 7 trillion fiscal cliffâ € ” a series of policies will kick in , from the blunt , across the board spending cuts ( or sequester ) to the expiration of the tax cuts that would reduce spending and raise taxes so abruptly and mindlessly it would put us back into recession			1
but ignoring and waiving the policies instead would add additional trillions to the debt and set us up for a fiscal crisis			1
a fiscal cliff or a mountain of debt			1
it will require presidential leadership to avoid either threat			0
while the likely approach will be to replace the slated policies with a gradual debt reduction plan that would bring the deficit down and leave the debt so that it is no longer growing faster than the economy , there are many different ways to achieve this -- all with pros and cons -- and many specifics that need to be filled in			1
however , the tendency during campaigns , of course , is for politicians to talk about what they promise not to do , rather than own up to the tougher decisions their stewardship would require			0
instead of allowing the presidential candidates to duck and bob to avoid specifically saying how they would stem the flow of red ink , what if voters insisted that all presidential candidates directly answer the question , " how would you fix the debt ? " quite simply , candidates should not even apply for the job of running the country if they are n't willing to share the details of their approach for fixing the debt			1
we should devote one of the three presidential debates to the topic of how , specifically , each candidate would change the budget , cut spending , and reform entitlement programs and the tax system to fix the debt			0
candidates must debate the debt , not duck it			1
at the debate , each candidate would present a detailed plan of his preferred approach for reducing the deficit			0
any plan should save at least $ 4 - 6 trillion over the next decade -- the amount most experts have pegged as the minimum needed to stabilize the debt -- or at the very least , a candidate should explain why his plan achieves any less			1
both president @entity85 and gov. @entity86 would have a lot of fleshing out of their plans to do before this debate			2
thus far , the president has only offered much smaller plans which are best described as a first step towards dealing with the problem rather than a full - blown plan , while @entity86 has offered a plan that could get control of the debt but with the bulk of the specifics on the spending cuts and tax breaks he would reduce , left blank , thus leaving none of the critical details filled in			1
in the debate , the candidates would be led through a discussion of their proposals on defense , domestic spending cuts , reforms to @entity111 , @entity112 , and other entitlement programs , and taxes , and make the case for their specific proposals			1
the plans could be scored by outside experts ahead of time so that fuzzy math would n't even enter the discussion			2
no avoiding the question , no magic asterisks , no talking about the fun parts , like lower tax rates or new investments , without the real work of detailing how they would pay for them			0
voters would see beneath the hoods and assess the trade - offs of the different approaches			2
certainly , either plan would not be the final word when one of the men becomes president , since it will go though many changes to achieve congressional support			0
but it would be the start of the conversation			0
it is unimaginable then that we should be asked to choose a candidate without knowing how they would serve as the country 's fiscal stewards during what experts have called the most predictable and most avoidable , economic crisis in history			2
and with so many difficult choices to be made quickly after the election , the notion that there will be some kind of mandate for how to proceed if the candidates have n't addressed this issue head on is both highly optimistic and dangerous			2
the stage afforded by the fall debates is the most viable possibility for compelling the candidates to answer these tough but necessary questions			0
it 's what they call an adult conversation , and we should give it a try			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 says public debt growing faster than economy ; this ca n't be sustained
she says soon @entity183 faces a $ 7 trillion cliff as fiscal policies kick in that could spark recession
she says candidates should be compelled in a debate to *outline* plans on cutting debt
@entity194 : voters ca n't be expected to choose without specific , fact - checked proposal
