-- @entity1 wants young girls to " ban bossy , " but for those of us soon - to - graduate , just - graduated and will - i - ever - graduate ladies just entering the working world , there 's another word that 's even more toxic			1
that word is " pushy			0
" at least , that 's what my @entity13 thinks			1
a new book by @entity1 , " lean in : for graduates , " targets women like us , but we were already paying attention			1
my @entity21 is all 20 - somethings with dreams of media industry success			0
we wanted our group to exist as a third - wave feminist answer to boys clubs , with their oak - paneled rooms and clouds of cigar smoke			0
we share job announcements , work dilemmas and interviewing tips and tricks			1
a guy recently asked me , " @entity13 -- is that , like , a book club ? " sort of			1
according to @entity1 's @entity39 , 14,000 @entity38 meet regularly around the globe , and we do n't just reread " @entity42 " over mimosas			1
@entity43 were conceived as " small peer groups that allow you to learn and share in an atmosphere of confidentiality and trust			0
" the @entity50 described the ethos as " @entity52 fused with @entity53 , " and i have yet to find a more accurate depiction of my particular circle environment			0
and so we formed , and rallied around our circle mission : to sit at the table and push back against " pushy " to find our first jobs			1
' wait your turn ' my mom was one of many who cautioned their daughters with the same advice : wait your turn , do n't be pushy			1
but when i was 22 , still in college , interning at a magazine in @entity68 and illegally subletting a run - down room , that advice just was n't cutting it anymore			1
i was one semester away from graduation and the real world , and i was dreading it			0
one of my internship supervisors jokingly introduced me to a colleague : " this is @entity77 , and she is terrified that she will graduate without a job			1
many of my peers moved back home with their parents to wait out this horrific economy , and unequivocally , they were miserable			0
many of my friends in journalism moved to cities like @entity68 or @entity89 and waited months for a job			1
some worked multiple part - time jobs to make ends meet , and every day without a lead meant more hope slipping away			1
when i was reading " @entity42 " within the mouse - ridden confines of my apartment , @entity1 's words stoked the long - squelched dreams that had always hovered in the top pages of my journals			1
as an @entity106 major and a journalism student , many of the feminist tenets in " @entity42 " were n't new to me , but they also were n't applicable to me yet			1
she urges women to find supportive significant others who will see a relationship as a partnership , not a trade - off			0
many of her stories about the intersection of family planning , motherhood and careerdom did n't have much of an effect			0
those were things i 'd been reading about in women 's studies textbooks for years , examples of how progressive society had helped women out of the home and into the workplace and back			2
what was new to me was her practical application of these sometimes abstract concepts			0
for every lesson , @entity1 had a story to share about boardroom drama at @entity134 , @entity135 and elsewhere			1
in my young life , i had n't had any @entity138 moments in which men looked up my skirt in the office or openly critiqued me for being a woman in a college classroom			2
instead , @entity1 's vivid depictions of workplace inequality -- of women who were constantly overlooked for the promotion , of female executives too shy to raise their hands in team discussion -- resonated as examples of the gender bias traps still harming women 's success			1
i had been passed on for projects because of reasons like " why would a girl be interested in politics ? " and the word " bitch " had been thrown at me to end a conversation			0
@entity1 's examples provided simple solutions : speak with purpose			1
@entity1 writes that many women struggle to be bold in workplace			1
in my case , it was in the world of job hunting			2
we fear that putting ourselves out there means we will be perceived as " pushy			0
" no one wants to be called that dreaded word just as she 's trying to get a job			1
i realized that not pushing hard enough for the job that i wanted was even scarier than not having a job			2
i feared that i would be waiting in the wings , clutching my pages - long @entity180 © and feeling insecure , as droves of confident , talented men dared to sit at the table			0
i knew to get that dream job , i was going to have to push forward and sit right beside those guys , just as @entity1 wrote			1
' is there a job there for me ? ' closing that confidence gap is n't easy , especially after a lifetime of " wait your turn			2
" i read that when @entity1 was job hunting -- honestly , more like " job picking " -- then - @entity135 ceo @entity194 gave her some invaluable advice , which ultimately became my guidepost			1
" only one criterion matters when picking a job -- fast growth			2
" in my own job hunt , in the midst of interviewing and applying , i found myself playing the same neurotic games many of my female peers have copped to : " did they even get my application ? " " @entity209 , they hated my application " and of course , " why did i even send in an application , i suck			2
" on the other hand , men send in applications even if they meet just some of the listed qualifications			0
" i 've been really forward ( almost to the point of being pushy ? ) in the last year , " a member of our @entity13 told me			1
" but the only consequence there might 've been for that is not getting a response to an application			0
" not all of @entity1 's advice resonated with my @entity21			1
business cards and job titles do n't mean much to us , and unlike many of @entity1 's contemporaries , we 've come up in a startup culture that eschews formalism			1
" a lot of my job search happened over beers , over shared criticisms , over social media interactions , " said one member of my @entity21			2
" if i said some of the suggested scripts she uses in the book , the person i was talking to would think i was a robot			2
when members of my @entity21 discuss job prospects -- which we 're doing ever - more - frequently as members prep for graduation -- the first question we ask is n't " what 's the position ? " instead , it 's " what would you be doing ? " the day before i graduated from college , i received a job offer from the magazine where i had interned while reading " @entity42			1
" the job was awesome			2
i would be living in a city i loved , working with amazing people and doing something i knew i was good at			0
but my heart was still set on another opportunity			0
a member of my @entity21 had referred me for a sweet spot on the @entity50 's digital engagement team , but after a few rounds of interviews i was still waiting for an answer			2
" you just have to wait , " people told me			0
my newly @entity1 - fied inner voice said otherwise			1
i called and explained the situation			0
" is there a job there for me ? " i remember saying			2
" we were going to offer you the job tomorrow , " my now - boss said			2
" so -- what are you thinking ? " ' that 's my girl ' at a recent brunch with a college friend , she told me she 's happy at her job , but looking for the next step , hopefully a new gig that will allow her to travel and improve her skills			1
" i want to e-mail these giants in my field to introduce myself and ask about job openings , " she said			2
" but i do n't want to			0
i do n't want to impose			0
they 're going to be like ' who is this girl ? why is she e-mailing me ? ' and i know my male colleagues would n't think twice			0
they 'd send that e-mail			0
" i immediately made a mental note to add her to our @entity21			0
i know my @entity21 members would say it 's an ongoing struggle for women in the workplace , and you have to lean in bit by bit			2
if anything else , you need to do it to improve the quality of workplaces for other women , even on the days when the confidence gap thwarts your plans to proceed boldly			0
so even when i could n't find a connection with @entity1 's discussion of work - life balance and motherhood or the buttoned - up culture of top tech executives , " @entity42 " ca n't just be written off as a book for mid-level career women			1
for me and my @entity21 -- all women new to our first job or still in college and looking for that first job -- @entity1 's simple suggestion to proceed boldly , empowered us to look at the job hunt and our workplace interactions			1
we 're wary of the gender gap not just in salary , but in how it shapes discussion and assignment in our offices			0
even in the early days of a new gig , we 're committed to closing that confidence ( and achievement ) gap			0
that 's something we can take away from the pages			2
that 's why a @entity21 is more than just a book club			1
in the middle of a conference call at work last week , i jumped into the conversation			0
" i can explain this , " i said , and launched into a short description of a project my team and i had been rolling out			0
" when you said ' i can explain this , ' you actually leaned in , " a female colleague said to me afterward			0
" you physically leaned in closer to the desk			0
i was like , ' that 's my girl			0

@entity77 read the **original** " @entity42 " shortly before graduating college
she 's part of a @entity13 , and used the ideas to push for a job
still , not all of @entity1 's **original** advice resonates with her generation , she said
