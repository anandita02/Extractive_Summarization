-- today is @entity1 -- the longstanding cornerstone of the holiday season -- and many retailers are seeing the need to unveil even more incredible offers than ever to battle the growing suggestion of @entity1 fatigue			1
@entity9 's holiday shopping study this year showed a rise in consumer apathy toward the @entity1 shopping tradition , with more than half of consumers ( 53 percent ) saying they were unlikely to or undecided on whether they will shop on @entity1 ( compared to 48 percent in 2009 )			1
traditionally , @entity1 , with its notorious " door - buster " deals , was the kick - off to the holiday shopping season , both for the store and the consumer			1
now , it could be argued that @entity21 marks the new holiday shopping starting point , as retailers try to catch as many sales as they can as early as possible with holiday advertising , promotions and an online push			1
this year will pose its own challenges in the fight for discretionary dollars as retailers also have to compensate for @entity32 falling on a saturday this year , meaning customers have one fewer weekend of holiday shopping			1
you can trace the increasingly lackluster consumer response to the @entity1 shopping tradition to the turbulent 2008 holidays			1
that year , we saw some retailers offer eye - popping discounts as high as 75 percent across their stores in early november to compensate for high inventories , high uncertainty , lower consumer confidence and less money in their pockets			2
this was a defining moment that dramatically changed the game			0
it not only took some of the gloss off @entity1 that year , but it also changed expectations for years to come of knowing when you would be able to snag the best holiday promotions and sales throughout the season			1
the growth in popularity of online shopping and the growing opportunity to find as many good deals online as in the store poses another challenge to @entity1 's popularity			2
the increase in the number of homes with broadband internet access means that more and more shoppers can afford to , and prefer to , stay home and bag the offers online , rather than brave the crowds			0
@entity9 's survey showed that 69 percent of consumers said that they will be buying holiday gifts online this year , up from 64 percent in 2009			2
despite this changing landscape , @entity1 is not finished			2
it is still a significant day for a huge number of consumers and the sense of tradition that many attach to it means that it still has a role to play			0
a number of retailers are already exploring creative opportunities to regain some of @entity1 's appeal and are looking at ways to engage with the customer through many different channels			0
some are offering deals throughout the week			0
some are opening their doors earlier			0
some offered door - buster savings on @entity95 on their websites			0
so instead of waking up at 4 a.m. -- or earlier -- and braving the elements with the rest of the die - hard shoppers for a couple of hours on friday , for many consumers , it was a simple question : " do i grab my laptop and surf the net for presents or sit in front of the tv to watch the game -- or both ? " the purpose of the brick - and - mortar store , however , is shifting from just being the place to make a transaction to providing more of an experience for the shopper			0
retailers have an opportunity to redefine @entity1 and stimulate excitement around the day , helping them to build customer loyalty throughout the season			2
with all the challenges , @entity1 will remain at the heart of the holiday shopping season for the foreseeable future and the winning retailers will be the ones that continue to go beyond the door - buster deal to win the hearts and minds -- and wallets -- of the consumer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			0

@entity1 losing significance as a *key* holiday shopping day , says @entity137
consumers are more likely to be *apathetic* and to shop online than in past years , she says
she says deep price cuts in 2008 holiday season changed consumer expectations
stores focus on shopping experience in an age of rising online sales , she says
