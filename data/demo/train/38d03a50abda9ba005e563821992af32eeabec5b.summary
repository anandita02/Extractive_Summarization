compounding the @entity1 military 's difficulties on the @entity5 island of @entity6 , a @entity1 airman is under investigation over allegations he broke into a local family 's home early friday and assaulted a teenage boy before jumping off a third - floor balcony			1
the incident is likely to further deepen resentment among @entity6 residents about the significant @entity1 military presence on the island			0
the situation was already extremely delicate following the arrest last month of two @entity1 sailors accused of raping a local woman			1
that case prompted angry protests from @entity5 officials and local residents			2
the @entity1 military responded by imposing a nighttime curfew on its thousands of troops in the country -- a restriction the airman appears to have disobeyed friday			2
according to @entity6 police , the suspect is alleged to have broken into the family 's apartment in the village of @entity37 around 1 a.m. friday , hit a 13 - year - old boy who was in bed and damaged a television set			1
the boy was left with an injury to his cheek			0
the airman suffered " possible broken bones and internal injuries " after jumping from the apartment 's balcony and has been admitted to a military hospital on the nearby @entity1 air force base of @entity50 , @entity1 military officials said			1
@entity5 foreign minister @entity53 called the incident " outrageous , " noting that it took place despite the @entity1 military curfew			1
he said the @entity5 authorities would lodge a complaint with the @entity1			1
the @entity1 ambassador to @entity5 , @entity61 , said he was also appalled by reports of the incident			1
" let me be absolutely clear : i am very upset -- it 's an understatement to say i 'm very upset , " he told reporters in @entity66 on friday , expressing concern about the well - being of the @entity5 boy who was allegedly attacked			1
he stressed that the @entity1 military forces in @entity5 are " undergoing a complete review of the liberty policies and other policies that will minimize , if not eliminate , any such incident in the future			2
" " it is incredibly unfortunate that the purported actions of a few reflect badly on thousands of young men and women here in @entity5 , away from their homes , that are here for the defense of @entity5 , " he said			0
@entity1 military officials on @entity6 , which lies south of the main @entity5 islands , were trying to deal with the fallout from the situation			2
" it is extremely regrettable when an alleged incident like this occurs , " said col. @entity87 , vice commander of the 18th wing of the @entity89 , which occupies the @entity50 base , the largest @entity1 military installation in the @entity93			0
" we are fully cooperating with @entity6 authorities on this investigation to ensure justice is served			0
" maj. @entity101 , the head of public affairs for the 18th wing , said he had met with the mayor of @entity37 on friday			0
" this is n't how we want our people to conduct themselves , " he said of the airman 's alleged behavior			0
@entity5 and @entity1 authorities declined to disclose details of the airman 's identity friday , other than that he was assigned to @entity50			1
the issue of violent crimes by @entity1 troops in @entity5 has divided the two countries for decades			2
it came to a peak in 1995 when a @entity1 sailor and two @entity1 @entity120 were convicted of raping a 12 - year - old girl			1
tens of thousands of @entity123 took to the streets at the time demanding that the @entity1 leave the island			0
relations between the @entity1 military and the people of @entity6 have also been strained in recent months over the @entity120 ' deployment of @entity131 tilt - rotor aircraft to a base on the island			0
some @entity6 residents are concerned because the @entity131 has had a reputation for crashing			0
the @entity6 community has long been against the presence of the @entity1 military , which recently announced that thousands of @entity120 will be moved to a base in @entity139 .			0
