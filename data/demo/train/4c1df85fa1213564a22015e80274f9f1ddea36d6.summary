@entity0 -- @entity0 @entity2 ban ki - moon exhorted member nations monday not to waver from efforts to meet the @entity5 they set for themselves a decade ago with a deadline of 2015			1
" we have led you to the river , so what are we asking of you today ? " he said to a @entity0 summit on global goals to fight poverty , hunger and disease			1
" to stay true , true to our identity as an international community built on a foundation of solidarity , true to our commitment to end the dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty			1
" the eight goals call for halving extreme poverty and hunger and achieving full employment ; achieving universal primary education ; promoting gender equality and empowering women ; reducing child mortality by two thirds ; reducing maternal mortality by three quarters and achieving universal access to reproductive health ; beginning to reverse the spread of @entity38 ; ensuring environmental stability ; and developing a global partnership for development that deals with developing countries ' debt			1
in a report issued before monday 's meeting , @entity43 said the summit is " crucially important " for meeting the anti-poverty goals			1
progress reaching the targets has been uneven , he said , and several of the goals are likely to be missed in many countries if additional efforts are not made			1
the @entity0 said almost 150 heads of state were expected to attend the meeting , which comes as many donor countries are tightening purse - strings in the wake of large fiscal deficits , rising debts and the global economic crisis			1
" but economic uncertainty can not be an excuse for slowing down our development efforts , " @entity43 said in the report			2
@entity67 president @entity66 proposed levying a tax on transactions through the world banking system and applying those funds to efforts to meet the goals			2
" why should we not as finance -- money -- to participate in stabilizing the world by being involved in imposing on each financial transaction a small tax ? " he asked			0
@entity81 president @entity80 blamed the transfer of natural resources from southern countries to those in the north for the world 's economic imbalance			1
" what we should discuss at this meeting , dear presidents , heads of state and heads of delegations , is how to put an end to this pillage of resources from the south , " he said			0
he called for the nationalization of natural resources " so the dividends they generate will remain in our countries and benefit our peoples			0
" he added , " we need investors , but they can not become owners of our natural resources			0
the state must be the owner of these natural resources			0
" @entity109 also called for the establishment of a bank for developing countries in the southern hemisphere , including those in @entity115 and @entity116			0
the bank , if funded with a percentage of the countries ' international reserves , could help the countries " break away from our dependency on the @entity123 and the @entity124 , " he said			2
during the four years he has served as president , the break with the @entity123 and the @entity124 has helped @entity81 , he said			0
" without the @entity123 , we 're better off than we were before , " he said , citing eradication of illiteracy , a drop in extreme poverty from 41 percent to 32 percent and a 42 percent drop in infant mortality			1
but @entity81 will not be able to meet the millennium goals unless the distribution of wealth is made more equal , he said , noting that a recent @entity0 report says that the poorest 40 percent of the world 's population has only 5 percent of global income , while 70 percent of world income goes to the top 5 percent of the world 's population			1
" that is unfair distribution of wealth , " he said			0
" our task should be oriented toward putting an end to this unfair distribution			0
" @entity152 president @entity151 called again for a two - state solution in the @entity154 -- a jewish state and an @entity157 state			0
" there is no other peaceful alternative to that conflict , and i believe we shall succeed , despite the differences , " he said			0
he also espoused the world body 's millennium goals			2
" a hungry world will never be peaceful ; a terrorized world will never be governable , " he said			0
@entity167 's @entity166 said his country has already achieved one of the goals -- ensuring that children in primary school stay in school , thereby ending youth illiteracy			2
but lack of regional peace represents a burden on development , he said			0
" when warfare and violence divert resources from social needs and economic growth , economies and community life are undermined and poverty and frustration grow			2
" he expressed hope that the development programs " can help build a foundation for peace			0
" the meeting to discuss @entity5 is a major item in a week that will include high - level discussions among international leaders as the @entity197 annual debate begins thursday			1
@entity0 officials are urging leaders to use the meetings as an opportunity to ratify dozens of international treaties ranging from protecting human rights to fighting terrorism to preserving biodiversity , a statement released by the organization said			1
last year , 64 countries took 103 treaty actions , the highest participation in four years , according to the @entity0 .			1

the @entity5 include halving extreme poverty by 2015
the @entity0 chief says progress reaching targets has been uneven
