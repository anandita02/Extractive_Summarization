-- each summer , @entity1 greets a stampede of sightseers and shoppers with eager cash registers			1
before jumping into the peak - season pig pile , consider the advantages of an off - season trip			2
major cities like @entity10 crackle with energy year - round			1
given the current weakness of our dollar overseas , the potential price - savings of an off - season trip are enough to brighten a gray winter day			2
airfares are often hundreds of dollars less			2
with fewer crowds in @entity1 , you 'll sleep cheaper			1
many fine hotels drop their prices , and budget hotels have plenty of vacancies			2
to save some money on hotels in the off - season , arrive late without a reservation , notice how many empty rooms they have ( look for keys on the rack ) , and give the receptionist an excuse to win your business with a deep discount			2
explain that you 're a senior ( hosteller , student , artist , whatever ) with a particular price limit , and bargain from there			0
note that while tourist - oriented places may be cheaper in the low season , the opposite is true of big - city business centers ( especially @entity47 and the @entity49 capitals ) , which are busiest and most expensive in the off - season			0
for many travelers , " shoulder season " -- april , may , early june , september and early october -- offers the best mix of peak - season and off - season pros and cons. in shoulder season you 'll enjoy decent weather , long days , fewer crowds and a local tourist industry that is still eager to please and entertain			1
outside of peak season , adventurers loiter all alone through @entity63 's home , ponder un-pestered in @entity65 's @entity64 , kick up sand on virgin beaches and chat with laid - back guards by log fires in @entity71 chateaux			1
in wintertime @entity72 you can be alone atop @entity74 bell tower , watching the clouds of your breath roll over the @entity78 domes of the church to a horizon of cut - glass @entity81			0
below , on @entity83 , hungry pigeons fidget and wonder , " where are the tourists ? " without the crowds , you can enjoy step - right - up service at tourist offices and experience a more @entity1			1
although many popular tourist - oriented parks , shows and tours will be closed , off - season is in - season for the high culture : plays and operas are in their crowd - pleasing glory			1
for instance , in @entity101 , while the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are scarce in the summer , all have a busy schedule of performances through the rest of the year			1
@entity1 's major cities crackle with energy year - round			1
in @entity108 , you can spend your days at the @entity109 and @entity110 , and your nights at a cozy pub or a world - class play			1
in @entity10 -- the @entity10 that always sparkles -- you can get face - to - face with @entity117 and scale the @entity118			0
in @entity119 , you 'll see @entity121 paintings and @entity122 without peak - season crowds			0
but winter travel has its drawbacks			1
because much of @entity1 is in @entity127 latitudes , the days are short			1
it 's dark by 5 p.m. the weather can be miserable -- cold , windy , and drizzly -- and then turn worse			2
but just as summer can be wet and gray , winter can be crisp and blue , and even into mid-november , hillsides blaze with colorful leaves			0
to thrive in the winter , you 'll need to get the most out of your limited daylight hours			0
start early and eat a quick lunch			0
pack for the cold and wet -- layers , rainproof parka , gloves , wool hat , long johns , waterproof shoes and an umbrella			0
use undershirts to limit the washing of slow - drying heavy shirts			0
cold weather is colder when you 're outdoors trying to enjoy yourself all day long			0
and cheap hotels are not always adequately heated in the off - season			0
off - season hours are limited			0
tourist information offices normally stay open year - round but have shorter hours in the winter			2
while most sights stay open through the winter , they typically operate on shorter schedules ( such as 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. rather than 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ) , with darkness often determining the closing time			0
winter sightseeing is fine in big cities , which bustle year - round , but it 's more frustrating in small tourist towns , which often close down entirely			1
in december many beach resorts are shut up as tight as canned hams			0
while @entity1 's wonderful outdoor evening ambience survives year - round in the south , wintertime streets are empty in the north after dark			1
english - language tours , common in the summer , are rare during the off - season , when most visitors are natives			2
another disadvantage of winter travel is loneliness			2
the solo traveler wo n't have the built - in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season			0
still , this can be a plus , since it encourages you to really connect with the locals you traveled halfway around the world to meet			0
regardless of when you go , if your objective is to " meet the people , " you 'll find @entity1 filled with them 365 days a year			1
