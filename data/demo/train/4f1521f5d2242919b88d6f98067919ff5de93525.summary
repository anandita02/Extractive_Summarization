-- when @entity1 signed up for her 1988 @entity3 100 meter trial in @entity4 , few expected fireworks			1
but those who were there to witness her quarterfinal run could n't comprehend what they were seeing			2
@entity12 , as she would later become known , had been a good , but not exceptional , 200 meter sprinter over the past seven years			1
she had failed to qualify for the boycotted 1980 @entity14 but had won silver at the @entity17 games four years later			1
she had n't run the 100 meters , not seriously , until now			1
the next ten - and - a - half seconds encapsulated everything that would define @entity12 for the rest of her life speed , elegance , beauty , femininity , suspicion			1
she got off to an indifferent start but at 60 meters found a different gear and destroyed the field in a way unseen in women 's sprinting			2
by the time she crossed the finishing line she had recorded a time of 10.49 seconds , almost four hundredths of a second quicker than her previous best before the trial , and a new world record			1
she had smashed it wearing her self - designed , one - legged jump suit and sporting her trademark mane of dark hair and long , painted finger nails			1
the commentator on @entity44 was dumbstruck			2
. it ca n't be , nobody can run that fast , " he stuttered when hearing the anemometer had recorded a legal wind speed			2
" they must have done something to the electronics because she won by such a margin ... it might be right but 10.4 ( 9 ) ... is incredible			1
" but the electronics , even if there was a suspicion of a fault , were deemed infallible and the record stood			2
the taint of drugs looking back at that moment her husband and then coach , the @entity63 winning triple jumper @entity64 , laughs when he recalls the reaction to the record			1
" at first , when she beat the record , they said it was wind assisted , " he exasperated			2
" later when she won the medals they said it was drugs			1
" the run was a prelude to that other unforgettable sprint performance at @entity84			1
@entity86 's brutal world record and subsequent ban for testing positive for steroids cast a long shadow over the @entity90 , and an even longer one over @entity12			1
she won gold in the 100 and 200 meters			1
in any era she would be hailed as the greatest of all time , a sprinter who transformed her discipline in the same way @entity95 has transformed his			2
but her improvement was so great , her times so exceptional , the change in her physique so profound that , for most , drugs -- steroids -- was the only answer			1
" it was jealousy , " @entity1 tells @entity0 , denying that @entity12 ever took drugs			1
" i trained her like a man			2
we did a lot of things then that they do now with nutrition			2
the things that separated her were her mental focus and toughness			2
my wife was great then and she is great now			2
" a humble start @entity1 was the seventh of eleven children brought up in @entity121 , a run - down public housing complex in @entity17			1
her running ability at 200 and 400 meters got her to college but she dropped out to become a bank clerk and part time hair stylist to support her family			2
it was only when she managed to secure a meager sponsorship that she could start to take running seriously			2
@entity1 still vividly remembers seeing his future wife for the first time			1
" i met her at the @entity135 @entity3 trial in 1980			0
i remember that because i never saw a woman look like that before ; she made me speechless , " he recalls			0
" @entity141 , his olympic gold medal winning sister ] was going through @entity143			1
eventually i came back out to train			0
i 'm doing distance running			0
so we start running together and started being friends			0
she 's was not only beautiful , but she could run			0
i thought i could run off and leave her but i could n't shake her			0
" the two married in 1987 and it was this emotional and financial stability that @entity1 credits , in part , to the huge jump that @entity12 made between that year and 1988			1
" @entity1 gave a lot of her love			1
i was the person that gave the love back , " he says			0
" she needed to know trust and faith and belief			0
" the other ingredient , according to @entity1 , was purchased in a local @entity163			1
" we bought a $ 150 leg exercise machine and she did leg curls every night			0
more than 20 lbs every night to build up the strength in her legs			0
she was working 12 hours a day			0
" @entity84 1988 @entity12 's incredible run at the @entity135 @entity170 had made her an object of suspicion when she arrived at the 1988 @entity90 in @entity84 , compounded by the shocking news of @entity86 's fall from grace			1
her preparations had n't been great			0
she ran an 11 second plus time at a meeting in @entity176 and then , according to @entity1 " 10.89 in @entity177 , @entity178 ( sic )			1
" although , on closer examination , that was into a headwind and was still as fast as @entity186 sprinter @entity185 could muster , the man who won silver in the men 's 100 meters			1
but @entity12 breezed through the heats at the @entity90 , recording a clean sweep of sub- 11 second times when she won a wind assisted final in 10.54 seconds			1
again she had an average start but burst free at 60 meters , annihilating the rest of the field			0
she was handed the @entity194 and headed towards her husband			1
" i feel so good that it 's over , " she said moments afterward			0
" i was n't chasing the time , i was chasing the win			0
a gold , that 's the first for me at the @entity90 and i just thank @entity203 that it 's over			1
" @entity64 was beaming by her side			1
" seeing my wife run 10.54 ... " he said , still a little shocked			2
" i predicted 10.57 but she always wants to run a little ahead of me			0
it brought tears to me			0
" but behind the scenes the suspicion had led to a string of drug tests for @entity12 , tests which @entity1 used as motivation for his wife			1
" she was being tested and i felt people were trying to get into her head , i had to keep her focused , " he says			0
" i told her : " go out there and run like you on jet fuel			0
" her next run in the 200 meters was even more remarkable			0
she smashed her own world record			1
both her 100 and 200 meter records still stand today , unbroken			1
" we performed all possible and imaginable analyses on her , " the president of the @entity232 's medical commission , prince @entity233 © rode , said at the time			0
" we never found anything			0
there should not be the slightest suspicion			0
" a clean slate ? @entity1 never did fail a drugs test			1
@entity84 would be her last @entity90			1
she retired afterward with a press conference at @entity241			0
her detractors point to the fact she retired just as compulsory random drug testing was being introduced			2
but @entity1 insists she left the sport to have a family			1
her only daughter was born in 1990			0
talk of a comeback at the @entity250 came and then went when she had a seizure that same year			2
two years later she died in her sleep			0
she was 38 years old			0
" we were dazzled by her speed , humbled by her talent and captivated by her style , " president @entity253 said			0
" that was september 21 , i was getting ready to take my daughter to school and i hear my wife 's alarm clock , " recalls @entity1 , who refers to @entity12 in the present tense throughout			1
" i turn off the alarm clock and my wife 's not moving			0
it was devastating looking at my daughter			0
when i see the @entity90 now it brings joy to me , all her hard work			0
they can say what they want to say			0
" @entity12 had suffocated during an epileptic seizure			1
at first her death at such a young age seemed to prove the suspicion of steroid use			2
there was intense interest in the autopsy			0
" i had to do my grieving in front of the whole world , " says @entity1 , only finding any measure of comfort " 30 days later after my wife 's autopsy			1
" the results in death , just as in life , had proven @entity12 right			1
there was no conclusive proof of drug use			2
" i told the doctor , they checked for everything , " he says			0
" they had people coming up all the time wanting to do tests			0
my wife passed the ultimate drugs test			2
" taking back @entity301 @entity1 is rarely mentioned without an invisible asterisk next to her name when the women 's 100 and 200 meters comes around in @entity3 year			1
current runners bemoan the unreachable bench mark she set			0
@entity3 200 meter gold medalist @entity307 got nowhere near it , saying it was beyond her reach			2
former 200 meter olympic champion @entity312 said that she " did not acknowledge those records ... to me they do n't exist and women sprinters are suffering as a result of what she did to the times in the 100 and 200			1
" yet her impact on the sport is there for all to see			0
" every time you see a woman in the 100 or 200 meters with make - up and nails , that 's @entity1 , " says @entity1 of his wife 's legacy			1
" she did it with style and she did it with speed			0
she was in a class by herself especially for all the women she opened the door for			0
her star will always shine			0
and it has the right to shine			0

@entity1 shocked the world when she won 100 and 200m gold at @entity345
in that year she smashed both world records , which still stand today
@entity12 had been dogged by *unfounded* drug *allegations* until her death in 1998
