@entity0 -- senate majority leader @entity2 said tuesday that a proposed ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons has no chance of passing the chamber , but he wants to ensure a vote on it will occur			1
the proposal to update a similar 1994 ban that expired a decade later was one of four measures passed by the @entity13 in response to the @entity16 school massacre in december			0
@entity2 , @entity17 , told reporters he wo n't keep the proposed ban in gun legislation heading to the full @entity13 for consideration because including it would guarantee the measure would be blocked by a @entity25 filibuster			1
the ban proposed by sen. @entity27 , @entity28 , and fiercely opposed by the @entity29 , @entity25 and some democrats would get fewer than 40 votes , @entity2 said , far below the threshold needed to defeat any filibuster or pass the @entity13			1
what 's in @entity27 's gun bill ? instead , @entity27 could propose the ban as an amendment to the gun legislation on the @entity13 floor in order to get a vote on it , @entity2 said			1
president @entity43 supports @entity27 's proposal			2
the other proposals passed by the @entity13 would expand background checks on gun sales , toughen laws against firearms trafficking and straw purchases , and design steps to improve school safety			2
@entity2 's move does n't come as a surprise as he has signaled for weeks he would only allow a vote on an assault weapons amendment			1
" i have to get something on the floor , " @entity2 said			2
@entity27 said she was " disappointed " with @entity2 's decision , which he told her about in a private meeting on monday			1
@entity27 : @entity29 is ' venal ' she acknowledged that other provisions of a gun - control package might have a better chance of passing without the controversial assault weapons ban			1
" the enemies on this are very powerful , " @entity27 said			0
" i 've known that all my life			0
" nevertheless , @entity27 said the issue was very important to her and she would not stop pursuing it			0
" i 'm not going to lay down and play dead , " she told @entity1 's " @entity70			0
" sen. @entity71 of @entity72 , the @entity74 whip , told @entity1 the proposed ban would make crafting broader legislation harder to accomplish			1
" @entity2 is trying to put together a base package that will get 60 votes on the floor , " @entity71 said			2
it is unclear , however , if any of the measures ultimately would clear the @entity13			0
" all these issues are important and i 'm going to what i can to make sure we have a fair , sound debate on this , " @entity2 said			0
" i want something to succeed			0
" @entity2 said he would schedule floor debate shortly after the @entity13 returns from its upcoming recess in april			0
@entity27 describes feelings during exchange with ' arrogant ' colleague @entity1 's @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 contributed to this report .			2

sen. @entity2 says the proposed ban on some firearms wo n't get enough votes
@entity2 will *introduce* gun legislation without the ban to ensure it clears a @entity25 filibuster
@entity2 says the ban 's sponsor , sen. @entity27 , can then offer it as an amendment
new : @entity27 says she is disappointed , but wo n't back down
