-- @entity6 , in an honest attempt to clarify communication about sexual consent in colleges and universities , has created just another way we can misunderstand each other			1
let me be clear : i support efforts to make rape or date rape or sexual opportunism when someone is drunk less likely			1
who would n't ? the law requires state colleges and universities to require " affirmative consent " from everyone engaged in sexual activity			1
consent " must be ongoing throughout			1
" the law specifies that silence and lack of protest makes consent impossible , and drunkenness is not an excuse			1
but this step - by - step consent plan is just not the way hot and heavy sex generally proceeds on college campuses			1
and it falls apart when you consider that a lot of sex on campus happens when people are drunk			1
that 's the real problem			1
except for truly malignant or misguided offenders -- " she asked for it " kind of guys -- most sexual calamities happen when students are drinking			1
in a study by @entity52 president @entity50 , students reported a mean of six drinks for men and four drinks for women on their last " ' hook up			0
" that 's just the tip of the iceberg , and that 's what we should be addressing : the over-drinking and under socialization about what makes sex worthwhile and why unconscious sex is not in anyone 's best interests			1
but instead of dealing with the real problem , legislators are going to have a standard of conduct that most dating couples or people who meet at a party will not follow			1
this wo n't be a problem -- until someone believes he or she did not give a specific permission			0
if it sounds like an easy thing to do , remember how you were in your late teens and 20s and you might recall that being articulate during sex is not so easy			2
legislating sex on campus will people really ask permission as they make the transition from oral sex to intercourse if their partner seems to be enthusiastically joining in ? unlikely			2
and if both partners are drunk , is one more culpable than the other ? i applaud the idea that both partners should be conscious , but do you think young men who throw a fraternity party think nobody will drink too much ? and do the young women who go to these parties expect to stay sober ? if we want to make rules about something , we should try to make rules about these parties			2
and we should try to educate young people about how easy it is to ruin their lives when they are drunk			2
but who are we going to punish if it 's a one - on - one encounter , both parties are drunk -- or not -- and each has different ideas of what was said ? as the professor of many university students and the mother of a girl and a boy who thankfully made it out of their 20s with no sexual and emotional scars , i worried about both my students and my kids in these years : i feared my daughter might get in a tough situation with a sexually aggressive date or that my son might be wrongfully accused by someone he did n't want to date any longer , or by a partner who changed her mind about what happened after a big night of partying			1
my fears were not baseless : i heard many examples of these kinds of situations			0
still , in our effort to protect the sexual victimization of women , we create a standard that is probably impossible to produce all the time			2
i am not convinced that young women can not be given the tools to say no , and men can not learn how to accept that answer			0
i think most young men want to be wanted and proceed when they think they are			0
yes , there are rapists who think they are wanted and that it 's just incidental that they have a knife in their hand when she consents			2
but these are the criminal and pathological minds that not only wo n't follow this regime , they wo n't even think it applies to them			0
other measures of avoidance and protection are necessary to save women from sociopaths			0
it 's laughable to think this kind of predator would even notice , much less follow , these rules			0
so who are they for ? the guys who might misunderstand what a woman wants and find themselves mystified when charges are brought against them ? will these rules protect them ? probably not , because i think those guys will believe that their partner 's behavior says it all			0
what would you do if you kissed someone passionately and he or she responded in kind ? would you ask permission before you began to use your tongue ? i 'm not saying no one can do this			0
i think many smart and caring men and women do ask permission along the way and are careful and sensitive observers of what their partner wants and says			0
i 'm all for encouraging that kind of protection of oneself and one 's partner			0
but i think most of this would be clear and careful if it were n't happening in an alcoholic fog , and that 's where i 'd put my money and educational efforts .			0

@entity6 requires colleges to require *participants* ' " affirmative consent " during sex
@entity221 : consent must continue , step by step , but that 's not how sex happens
@entity221 : being drunk or high is the real cause of sexual calamities in college
she says if you want to stop misunderstandings and assault , you must address *overdrinking*
