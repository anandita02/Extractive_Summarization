@entity0 -- a @entity3 tabloid declared sunday that " secret @entity7 files " reveal @entity4 paid millions to silence dozens of boys he abused			1
the story quickly echoed throughout global media , perhaps in part because of the trial of the @entity13 's wrongful death lawsuit against a concert promoter and the recent suicide attempt by @entity4 's teenage daughter			1
a website can enjoy a sharp spike in traffic -- which can translate into advertising revenue -- with a sensational headline			0
but journalists and others who have closely followed the controversies and legal fights surrounding the pop star found the description by the @entity29 newspaper of the documents as being from @entity7 files to be questionable			1
' recycled tabloid reports ' " none of this is new -- zero -- and there was no @entity7 involvement , " said @entity34 reporter @entity33			1
" it just sounds like recycled tabloid reports from 20 years ago			0
" @entity33 saw and reported on the same material more than a decade ago as a local @entity0 reporter			1
" the bottom line is this stuff was not in the @entity7 files , " said @entity43 , the lawyer who successfully defended @entity4 against child molestation charges in a lengthy trial in 2005			1
" the @entity7 closed the investigation			2
it sounds like a bunch of utter nonsense			0
" journalist @entity51 , who is no defender of the pop icon , also attacked the @entity29 article			1
" it is obvious the paper took this old story and proceeded to make it seem new by adding numbers to it -- 24 boys paid off $ 35 million by @entity4 , " @entity51 said			1
" the problem is there 's no evidence to back up the claim that @entity4 made that many payoffs			1
" @entity51 's book " @entity67 : inside the @entity72 " details her coverage of allegations of improper relationships between @entity4 and boys			1
the tabloid report was published at a critical time for the @entity13 , as its wrongful death lawsuit against a concert promoter entered its 10th week and while @entity4 's daughter , @entity78 , is being treated after a reported suicide attempt			2
" the files will also dismay @entity4 's kids , @entity83 , 16 , @entity78 , 15 , and 11 - year - old blanket , who have not yet come to terms with losing their father , " the @entity29 story said			1
@entity4 considered the @entity89 tabloids ' use of " @entity4 " to be a derogatory term			0
@entity33 , @entity51 and @entity43 each point to @entity92 , a former porn actor who lost his private investigator 's license for fabricating evidence , as the person who possessed the material published sunday			1
it included an audio recording of an interview done by @entity101 , a reporter with the @entity104 - based @entity103 tabloid , with a couple who worked as chefs at @entity4 's @entity108			2
@entity101 left the tape to @entity110 when he died of cancer in 1997			0
" @entity92 made it no secret over the years that he had come into possession of the @entity101 tapes and that they included a long interview with @entity118 and @entity119 , the former live - in couple at @entity108 , " @entity51 said			2
Â " he discussed the tapes and their contents with me on several occasions			0
" @entity33 said @entity92 also gave him access to the material years ago			2
it included reports @entity92 wrote when he worked for now - disgraced celebrity investigator @entity126			0
@entity126 is serving a 15 - year federal prison sentence for a wiretapping and racketeering convictions			0
porn star turned @entity131 " since @entity92 has fairly recently been stripped of his @entity131 's license , i can imagine that money has been tight for him , " @entity51 said			1
" my best guess is that the @entity89 paper offered mr. @entity92 several thousand dollars for his copies of the old @entity126 files			0
" when @entity1 called @entity92 on tuesday to ask if he sold the materials to the newspaper , he responded : " i have no comment and that 's all i have to say			2
" but before the question could be posed , he asked if the reporter wanted to know how many times he 's had sex in a hammock			0
he explained it was a common question people ask because of his porn film career			0
@entity92 's films , with titles such as " married men with @entity153 " and " @entity154 and @entity155 , " won him the @entity157 ' award for best " group grope scene " in 1985 and he was inducted into the @entity161 's @entity160 in 2008			0
@entity92 , now 60 , retired from the porn business to focus more on his investigative work , but court records suggest he was not as successful in that work			0
he obtained a @entity168 private investigator 's license in 2009 , but lost it three years later			1
he signed a " stipulated settlement " with the state admitting that he faked a report about an ex-girlfriend 's drug use to get her fired from her hospital job as a nurse in 2011			0
federal court records also show @entity92 and his wife filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010			0
tabloid stands by story a @entity29 spokesman would not confirm that @entity92 was the paper 's source or if it paid for access , but he did stand by the story			2
" our article clearly states that we have seen copies of reports , phone transcripts and interviews carried out by an agent working for private investigator @entity126 who had been hired by @entity4 , " @entity187 said in an e-mail to @entity1			1
" the files were seized by the @entity7 when @entity126 was himself investigated in 2002			2
the documents then became part of the @entity7 's files on @entity4 case numbers cadce @entity201 and @entity202			1
" in fact , the @entity7 released files it collected on @entity4 in december 2009 , six months after his death			1
most of them related to the federal agency 's support of the @entity168 investigations of child molestation allegations against the entertainer			0
@entity214 , who were investigating child molestation allegations against @entity4 , called the @entity7 's @entity0 office in september 1993 to suggest the agency look into a " possible federal violation against @entity4 concerning transportation of a minor across state lines for immoral purposes ( @entity224 ) " , one document said			1
the @entity226 district attorney did not pursue criminal charges against @entity4 , but the singer did reach a confidential financial settlement with the 1993 accuser , @entity230 , and his father after they filed a lawsuit			0
reports at the time said the @entity235 got between $ 16 million and $ 20 million from @entity4 's insurance company			2
the @entity238 accusation became a key part of the prosecution 's case when @entity4 was tried and acquitted of molestation a decade later in @entity243 , @entity168			2
@entity43 , who reviewed the 330 redacted pages released by the @entity7 , said the documents purported by the newspaper to have been included in the files were not there			1
@entity1 also reviewed the files , which are still posted on the @entity7 website , and found none referring to other payoffs by @entity4			1
none of the file numbers matched those quoted by the newspaper			0
" you can imagine what the prosecutor in @entity243 would have done with this information if they really had it , " @entity43 said			0
@entity262 did testify , telling the court that he once caught @entity4 improperly touching then - child actor @entity264 while he worked as @entity4 's self - described cook and " majordomo " for about 10 months in 1991			1
@entity264 , the second witness called in @entity4 's defense , denied any improper touching by @entity4			2
@entity4 's guilt is ' inconsequential ' @entity92 represented the @entity271 in an attempt to sell their story to tabloid media outlets , @entity43 said			1
@entity119 admitted at the trial that he tried to make money from his story , even meeting with @entity279 , who promised him $ 100,000 from the tabloid press , maybe more if the story were dirtier			0
" he began to make the story more and more graphic as the price went up , " @entity43 said , referring to @entity282			2
" was it true that the broker told him the payoff might be higher if mr. @entity4 's hand was inside @entity264 's pants ? " @entity43 asked during cross examination			1
" that 's what he said , " @entity119 said			0
@entity92 discussed his deal with the @entity271 in an interview for a @entity296 " @entity297 " documentary in 1994			0
" my interest in helping them was that they promised me a percentage of what they made , " @entity110 said			0
" i was not on any kind of crusade to bring anyone to @entity307 was guilty or innocent at that point was @entity309 my interest was strictly for the money , as was theirs , i might add			0

@entity1 's @entity33 : " none of this is new -- zero -- and there was no @entity7 involvement "
