-- in the sight of @entity3 's @entity2 , the man who would be king awaits his destiny			2
diminutive and unassuming , @entity7 's faith in his ability has never been in question -- but a @entity12 - like shadow has always haunted him			1
if @entity13 is a deity to @entity15 , then @entity7 is a prophet			1
" he was our water in the desert , " national coach @entity16 said of @entity7 after his side 's @entity18 quarterfinal victory over @entity20			1
@entity7 may not be moses -- the ability to turn a rock into a pool of water is a stretch too far even for the @entity30 star -- but his football powers frequently attract supernatural praise			1
after his two goals against @entity35 , opposition coach @entity33 declared that @entity7 was of a different planet -- specifically @entity37 , although he did n't explain why			1
@entity7 's achievements are well documented -- 381 goals in 466 matches for @entity30 , three @entity42 titles and six @entity45 @entity44 triumphs only tell half the story			1
four times he has been named world player of the year , while his face is posted on billboards across the world , with sponsors clamoring for his signature			0
and yet , back where it all began , he does not receive the same affection as he does in the streets of @entity58			0
" the name of @entity13 will always be a heavy burden on @entity7 's shoulders , " says @entity59 , one of @entity61 's leading sports journalists			1
@entity13 only ever won a @entity65 with @entity30 , before guiding @entity66 to two @entity68 league titles , but it was on the international stage where he truly left his mark -- most notably leading @entity61 to @entity18 glory in 1986			1
" @entity13 's achievements as a footballer were absolutely stunning , " @entity73 told @entity0			2
" he used his gifts and guts to beat them all one by one before winning the @entity18 in a glorious performance			1
" as much as his skill at @entity87 ' 86 , @entity13 's use of his hand to deflect the ball past @entity84 goalkeeper @entity83 in @entity61 's 2 - 1 quarterfinal victory is still debated to this day			1
was he a cheat or was this a professional doing anything to create an advantage for his team ? a bit of both , according to @entity13			0
" a little bit by the @entity12 , another bit by the head of @entity13 , " is how he described his goal afterwards			0
" that is why people forgive him for almost everything and still celebrate even the ' @entity12 ' goal as an emblem of cunning and hunger of triumph , " says @entity73			0
@entity13 's performances at that tournament still astound to this very day			2
the way he ran through the bewildered @entity84 defense in @entity111 to score his second goal , just minutes after his first controversial effort , led to it being labeled one of the greatest in football history			0
in the semifinal @entity13 scored twice against @entity20 in a 2 - 0 win , beating four @entity118 defenders to score his second goal			0
in the final , he set up @entity120 to score the winning goal as @entity61 claimed a 3 - 2 victory over @entity123			1
his performances secured hero status in @entity61 and allowed him build up a huge amount of goodwill which would be sorely tested later when he was banned for drugs at the 1994 @entity18			1
@entity13 , was a man of the people , a boy who had grown up playing football on the streets of @entity133 , fighting each and every day to make his way in the world			0
he had something about him that people could relate to -- something @entity7 , for all of his qualities , did not possess			2
" @entity140 does n't have the charisma or the eccentric side which helped build @entity13 's gifts as a player , " says @entity73			2
" he had a provocative and flamboyant personality -- he 's still known as @entity12			0
" but nobody can live on the past and the future depends on @entity7 's talents , otherwise there will be nothing more but nostalgia			1
" @entity7 and @entity13 could scarcely be more opposite in character and lifestyle			2
in the lead - up to the triumphant @entity18 triumph in 1986 , @entity13 was in a daze			1
a public row over an illegitimate child with his mistress threatened to ruin the nation 's hopes , while throughout his career he was linked with the @entity164 -- the @entity166 mafia -- and , having suffered defeat in the 1990 world cup final against @entity123 , was then banned for drug taking at the 1994 tournament in the @entity171 but in 1986 he single - handedly carried an @entity15 nation , still recovering from the impact of the @entity174 , onwards to victory			1
it was the pinnacle of his international career which spanned 91 games and 34 goals			0
@entity7 is more of a private and retiring type -- while he is not shy in coming forward with the ball at his feet , he does not command the same attention within @entity61 that @entity13 enjoyed			1
much of that has to do with @entity7 's upbringing			1
while @entity13 grew up and made his name in @entity61 , @entity7 moved to @entity30 at the age of 13			1
he is quite open about the decision to uproot from his hometown of @entity190 in @entity191 and move halfway across the world			0
" when i was 11 years old they discovered that i had a growth hormone deficiency and i had to start a treatment to help me to grow			0
every night i had to stick a needle into my legs , night after night after night , every day of the week , and this over a period of three years , " he said in the book " @entity7 , " by @entity197			2
" i was so small , they said that when i went onto the pitch , or when i went to school , i was always the smallest of all			0
it was like this until i finished the treatment and i then started to grow properly			0
" and grow he did -- not just in height but in stature too			0
@entity7 was the focal point of @entity214 's @entity30 revolution and the emergence of tiki - taka football which dominated @entity45 and @entity218 football			1
yet as his stock at @entity30 rose with each passing game , those back in @entity61 remained skeptical			2
the accusation was that @entity7 was not one of them			2
this was a player who had abandoned his homeland before he had managed to form any kind of @entity15 identity -- he was @entity229			0
" there are still some people -- too many people in my opinion , because there should n't be any at all -- who are n't totally convinced by him , " @entity15 football expert @entity230 told @entity0			0
" but the vociferousness of his celebrations , the quality of his performances since @entity16 took charge in particular , and his undoubted centrality to the team , has now won over all but the most tiresome drunken critics			0
" he does n't have the same ' everyman ' feel as @entity13 , and it 's difficult to imagine him ever shooting his mouth off as much , but bearing in mind he 's only just turned 27 i think he will one day be considered on the same level as @entity13 the player -- but the warmth of feeling for the person might never quite match up to @entity13			0
" four years ago , when @entity7 and @entity13 combined their powers at the @entity258 -- it proved disastrous			2
@entity7 failed to sparkle , @entity13 cut a figure of fun on the touchline as coach and @entity61 was thrashed 4 - 0 in the quarterfinal by a rampant @entity123			1
perhaps now it is time for revenge , for on sunday , @entity7 will captain @entity61 in the @entity18 final -- his 93rd appearance for the @entity61 -- against @entity123			1
he has managed 42 goals in that time , four of which have come in this tournament			0
now more than ever , @entity61 needs @entity7 -- it needs the ability to escape the problems which threaten to plague the country , notably a $ 100 billion default , with the economy shrinking by 11 % and unemployment sky - rocketing			1
@entity15 officials will meet with a mediator in @entity280 on friday to end a long - running dispute with investors who turned down restructuring terms on the nation 's debt after 2002			0
president @entity286 has not missed the opportunity to take advantage of the @entity18 , with the government running nationalistic adverts on state - run television during the games			2
if the tactic is to distract the public then it has worked to some extent -- and @entity7 has played his part			2
those celebrating the prospect of a first @entity18 final in 24 years allowed their worries to disappear at least temporarily as they celebrated the nation 's @entity303 with extra fervor			1
but if @entity61 fails to reach a deal by july 30 , it will fall into its second sovereign debt in 12 years			2
for the moment , though , monetary difficulties are put to one side as the nation fixates on the chance to become world champion for the first time in 28 years			0
" i do n't remember such feeling of contentment since i was a child and the return of democracy after the dictatorship in 1983 and then again when we won 1986 @entity18 , " added @entity73			1
" in a time of economic crises and scandals of corruption in the government , this moment provides a huge relief in the middle of adversity			0
" so reaching the final game gives us real happiness and makes the country proud			0
" @entity123 represents an almighty challenge for @entity7 and his team			1
this side , which obliterated host nation @entity338 7 - 1 in tuesday 's semifinal , believes this is the moment its potential is finally fulfilled			0
but for @entity61 , this opportunity is one it can not afford to pass up after waiting for so long			2
" @entity338 , @entity347 " — translated to " @entity338 , @entity348 " -- is the song that has been sung throughout the tournament by @entity15 fans confident of their team 's success			0
those words have become more venomous since @entity338 's abject exit , and those who had dreamed of a home victory could be about to witness the host country 's worst nightmare -- an @entity15 @entity18 - winning party on the @entity357			1
that is the dream that 40 million @entity15 will pray for their footballing prophet to deliver .			0
