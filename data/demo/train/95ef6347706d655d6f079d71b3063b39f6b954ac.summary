-- @entity1 held off a furious late onslaught from @entity3 co-hosts @entity4 to win 1 - 0 in their opening group b match in @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity9 , left , fouls @entity1 striker @entity10 to concede the match - winning penalty			1
the @entity13 took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder @entity15 coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after @entity19 clumsily body - checked striker @entity10 in the area			1
@entity22 's team dominated the first half , and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but @entity10 's strike partner @entity24 blazed over the bar with a left - foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to @entity29 's cross			1
@entity4 's main threat had come from set - pieces , but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners			1
however , the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes			1
@entity40 fired over the bar on 78 as @entity1 scrambled to clear the danger , then substitute @entity43 had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper @entity45 , who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder			2
@entity45 also had to deny a driven shot from @entity49 , who also came off the bench , while another substitute in @entity52 flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on			0
@entity1 went into the tournament as one of the outside bets , having qualified top of their group ahead of @entity61 with a victory away to @entity63 which eliminated the @entity65 team			2
however , their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer @entity69 was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg			0
none of @entity1 's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches , and the @entity77 forward 's goal - poaching ability was sorely missed on sunday			1
the winning goal came after @entity15 and @entity10 combined down the left wing from a throw - in , and @entity19 clearly impeded the striker well away from the @entity4 goal			1
the @entity84 defender was booked for protesting the referee 's decision , but he could have no complaints with the ruling			0
@entity4 are the lowest - ranked of the 16 teams at the tournament in 92nd place , but showed great courage against a 15th - seeded @entity1 side stacked with attacking talent			1
but they joined fellow co-hosts @entity96 in losing their opening match , following the @entity101 's 1 - 0 victory on saturday			1
@entity1 next play @entity102 on thursday , when @entity4 take on @entity103			1
coach @entity22 was delighted to start with a victory , but was not so impressed with his team 's performance			0
" some players were overwhelmed by playing at a great tournament but we started off with the best possible way -- with a win , " @entity22 told reporters			0
" in the first 35 minutes we played excellently , of course the early lead contributed to that			0
" they exerted more pressure in the second half and i 'm sure that is not to do with a lack of strength from our players			0
but we confined ourselves to our penalty area too early			0
" the last 15 minutes or so when they play all or nothing , you can do that -- but we started in the 60th minute or so			2
i did n't think the players were happy when they got back in the dressing room			0
i turned on the cd player and said they should sing because they won			0
" @entity4 coach @entity134 was left frustrated by his side 's failure to take their chances			1
" this was the worst possible start you can have in an opening match of a major tournament , " he said			2
" we took some time to recover , during the first 30 minutes we were nervous			0
" for the rest of the match we were playing the way we should have been playing			0
we even dominated in the second half of the match			2
we had good opportunities but unfortunately we were n't able to score a goal , so we are empty - handed			0
in our remaining games we need four points to go through			0
