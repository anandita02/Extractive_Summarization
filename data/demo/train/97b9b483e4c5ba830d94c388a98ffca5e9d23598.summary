-- this week 's @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , reaches a notable milestone as the tournament celebrates its 40th year -- the oldest @entity7 event on the circuit			1
the tournament has been hosted in the grounds of @entity11 for the past 14 years , after various different venues in the @entity3 area , and its roll - call of former winners reads like a who 's - who of women 's tennis			2
@entity20 holds the record for most singles titles , with five between 1979 and 1993			0
reigning @entity24 champion @entity23 has four wins , with @entity28 legends @entity26 and @entity29 and @entity30 with three victories each			2
and , in recognition of reaching the landmark , tournament organizers have arranged a special presentation before the semifinals on saturday july 31			0
four former champions , each representing a different decade , will be paraded ; inuaugural champion @entity30 ( 1970s ) , two - time champion @entity40 ( 1980s ) , @entity29 ( 1990s ) and defending champion @entity41 ( 2000s )			1
it was fitting that @entity30 won the initial tournament , as she had fought so hard for the introduction of the @entity7			1
and , the 1971 tournament at the @entity47 , in which @entity30 beat @entity48 in the final of an event then known as the @entity1 , was to become the first of 24 events that year that formed the first - ever @entity7 calendar			1
the tournament became the @entity55 of @entity3 in 1974 and its venue moved around the @entity47 area before settling at the @entity58 between 1979 and 1996			2
the tournament has continued to grow and grow since moving to @entity60 , with @entity61 director of tennis @entity62 telling the local @entity65 website : " it 's been a great marriage and just about every great player from the last 14 years has played here			0
" it 's been a really great thing for not only @entity61 , but for the @entity3 community in general			0
" @entity73 @entity72 is the top seed for the 2010 version , although injury means that the @entity78 sisters -- who both hail from the area -- will not be in action .			0
