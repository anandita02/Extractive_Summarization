checking off the world 's most important natural and cultural wonders can be a herculean task			1
the @entity3 -- that most lauded and recognizable of preservation lists -- includes nearly 1,000 sites all over the world			1
that number will almost certainly increase when the @entity8 of the @entity9 meets june 15 - 25 in @entity10			2
instead of sorting through that encyclopedic list , why not start at the very beginning with the first 12 sites ? the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 in the @entity16 and the @entity17 in @entity18 were among the 12 sites named to the first list in 1978			1
only countries that sign the convention creating the @entity8 and list can nominate sites , and that was just 40 countries when the first nominations came out			1
thirty - six years later , 191 nations have signed the convention			2
" there is an incredible diversity of sites both natural and cultural around the world , " said @entity29 , deputy director of @entity9 's @entity30 , a 22 - year veteran of the organization			1
" the beauty of this convention is that the text defining natural and cultural heritage is very broad			1
" being named to the list is a big deal			1
government officials work for years to prepare their nominations , and preservation officials hope for those designations to support their work			0
and what tourist site does n't tout its @entity3 designation ? while we wait to learn the newest members of this prestigious list , here are the first 12 world heritage sites , listed in the order in which they are listed in the minutes of the september 1978 meeting in @entity56			1
@entity57 , @entity58 what 's left of the 11th - century @entity61 settlement at @entity62 on the island of @entity64 in @entity58 is the earliest evidence of the first @entity67 presence in @entity68			1
excavations have found timber - framed , peat - turf buildings like those found in @entity72 and @entity73 during the same period			2
it 's the first and only known @entity61 site in @entity68			2
the site was protected by the government of @entity58 in 1977 , just a year before its inclusion on the @entity3			1
@entity77 , @entity58 located in @entity58 's @entity78 along the @entity79 and the @entity80 , @entity77 was protected as a national park by @entity58 in 1972			2
@entity77 includes almost every known type of @entity68 river and stream , enormous waterfalls , granite peaks , deep canyons , a unique limestone cave system and evidence of ancient rivers			0
some 40 types of mammals and 170 bird species call this park home			0
@entity13 , @entity14 the 19 islands and surrounding marine reserve that are the @entity13 are part of a unique archipelago of unusual animals , plant life and seismic activity that inspired @entity104 's theory of evolution			1
located about 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles ) from the @entity107 continent where three currents meet in the @entity109 , the @entity13 host an intriguing collection of animal and plant life			1
residents include the blue - footed booby , giant tortoises , flightless cormorants and marine iguanas			2
some 97 % of the total emerged surface was declared a @entity15 in 1959			1
the @entity120 was created in 1986 with an area of 70,000 kilometers and was expanded to 133,000 kilometers in 1998			0
city of @entity123 , @entity14 named for the @entity125 , who lived in the area before the @entity129 conquest , the capital city of @entity14 was built in the 16th century on the ruins of an @entity132 city			1
despite many earthquakes , @entity123 's historic center is quite well - preserved			1
see the style of the @entity137 school of @entity123 , a fusion of @entity67 and indigenous elements , in the monasteries of @entity141 and @entity142 and the @entity143 and @entity144 of @entity145			0
built in the old @entity129 style , the cathedral , archbishop 's palace , government palace and city hall face onto the city 's main square			2
@entity153 , @entity154 incredible mountain peaks , deep valleys and rare animals call @entity153 home			1

there are also leopards , spotted hyenas , jackals and 400 bird species			0
the park holds incredible significance because of its biodiversity , with views said to rival the @entity176 in the @entity16			0
however , it was established in an area inhabited by people and faces human and livestock demands on its resources			0
@entity184 , @entity185 , @entity154 at a time when @entity188 conquests made it impossible for @entity189 to make pilgrimages to the @entity192 , @entity185 decided in the 12th century to build a " @entity194 " in the mountain region of @entity154			1
the 11 medieval , monolithic cave churches of the 13th century are the result			1
the churches were hewn from rock , and doors and windows and other parts of the structures were chiseled out			1
there 's also an extensive system of passages , ditches , caves and catacombs			2
@entity185 's churches and traditional village are still a place of pilgrimage and devotion where the faithful flock to celebrate the important dates of the @entity154 @entity217 calendar			1
@entity218 , @entity219 the @entity221 royal estate of @entity218 in western @entity219 had served as a spa since the first century			2

the chapel was considered an artistic wonder from its creation			0
it had bronze doors , columns of @entity243 and @entity244 marble and a grand mosaic ( now destroyed )			0
the unification of the @entity247 under @entity224 is symbolized in part by the construction of the chapel between 793 and 813			0
@entity224 was buried there in 814 , and 200 years later , he was canonized -- attracting pilgrims to the site			0
@entity256 's historic center , @entity257 the former capital city of @entity257 , @entity256 's historic center has its roots in the 13th century as a merchants ' town with @entity67 's largest market square and one of the oldest university quarters in @entity67			1

the beginnings of the castle date back to the 11th century , and there are remnants of fortifications dating back to the 14th century			2

@entity303 and @entity304 , @entity257 while the @entity303 and @entity304 in @entity257 are excellent examples of mining techniques from the 13th to the 20th centuries , there is much more in their underground chambers than a historical ode to the mining of salt			0
areas excavated for salt were turned into storehouses , workshops and chapels , with statues and other decorations carved into the rock salt			0

island of @entity17 , @entity18 from the 15th century through the 19th century , an estimated 20 million @entity325 passed through the @entity17 , the largest slave - trading center on the @entity325 coast			1
