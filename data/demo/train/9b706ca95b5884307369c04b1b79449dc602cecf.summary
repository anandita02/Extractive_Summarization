@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity8 prime minister @entity7 fought to hold on to his job thursday in a debate against the two men who hope to replace him , @entity3 of the @entity4 and @entity5 of the @entity6			1
but he lost the debate decisively , according to two snap polls			1
@entity3 came first in both polls , with @entity5 second and @entity7 third			1
but the debate performances do not seem to have changed voters ' minds about whom to back , according to one poll			0
just over a third of voters say they favor the @entity4 , and the same number back the @entity6 , according to the poll by @entity27 for @entity28			2
just under one - quarter prefer @entity31 , the poll suggests			0
those numbers are essentially unchanged from the results after a similar debate last week			0
in this week 's debate , @entity7 repeatedly insisted that @entity3 represents " the same old conservative party , " which would take money out of the economy for " ideological reasons			1
" the conservatives are ahead of @entity7 's @entity31 in most polls , but it 's not clear that the lead will be enough to give them a majority when voters cast ballots on may 6			1
a confident - seeming @entity3 fended off @entity7 's attacks , saying time and again that @entity7 was wrong on the facts			1
" @entity3 , you 've just got it wrong economically , " @entity7 said in one of the sharpest exchange , saying his party was " the same old conservative party of the 1930s and the 1980s and the 1990s			1
" " every leading business leader says we have got it right , " @entity3 shot back			1
they crossed swords again about unemployment , with @entity7 warning " we do n't want the labor market of the 1980s , " when the @entity4 were in power			1
" it 's the same old @entity65			0
" @entity3 fired back that @entity7 does n't " even know what country you 're prime minister of -- he 's caused record youth unemployment			1
" full election coverage @entity7 continually shook his head as @entity3 leveled criticism at the @entity31 , while @entity3 tended to stare ahead into the studio audience when he came under attack			1
@entity5 , whose @entity6 are traditionally also - rans but are riding high on the back of their leader 's debate performances , struggled to appear relevant as the leaders of the two big parties traded barbs			2
" the way they got us into this mess is not the way out , " he said , gesturing to the politicians on either side of him			0
the first half of the debate focused on the economy , one of the main concerns on voters ' minds			0
members of the audience asked about government spending cuts , the fairness of the tax system , bankers ' bonuses , and how to rebuild the @entity8 manufacturing sector			0
the debate got even sharper in the second half when the hot - button issue of immigration came up			0
@entity3 accused the @entity6 of wanting an " amnesty for illegal immigrants , " while @entity5 shot back that the only politician who wanted that was the @entity4 mayor of @entity0 , @entity111			2
voters across @entity1 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 cast ballots for 650 members of @entity118 on may 6			0
the party with the largest number of mps traditionally gets the first chance to form the government			0
either @entity31 or the @entity4 usually gets an absolute majority , but polls suggest the @entity6 may capture enough seats to prevent one party from having more than half of the seats in @entity118			2
quirks in the voting system mean that the party with the most votes does not always get the most seats			0
the last time no party got a majority , in 1974 , a new election was called within months			0
@entity31 has been in power in @entity8 since 1997 , first under @entity139 , and under @entity7 since 2007			2
the conservatives governed @entity8 for 18 years before that .			2
