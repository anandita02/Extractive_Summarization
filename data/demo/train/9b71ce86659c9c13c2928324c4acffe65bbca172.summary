-- as of february , more @entity2 adults own smartphones than simpler feature phones , according to new research from the @entity6			1
well , to be more specific : in answering questions from @entity6 , 45 % of cell phone owners said that their phone is a smartphone			1
also , 49 % of cell phone owners said that their phone operates on a smartphone platform common to the @entity2 -- which includes @entity15			1
according to @entity6 : " taken together , just over half of cell owners ( 53 % ) said yes to one or both of these questions			1
" here 's how it breaks down , by platform : 20 % of @entity2 cell phone owners currently have an @entity25 phone			1
for @entity26 , 19 %			0
@entity15 , 6 % ( a 10 % drop since as recently as may 2011 )			0
since may ( the last time @entity6 gathered these statistics ) , the biggest growth in smartphone ownership was among adults aged 18 to 24 ( up 18 % ) ; the next highest growth was among those aged 45 to 54 ( 16 % )			1
other demographic segments with high growth in smartphone use include whites ( 15 % ) ; those with some college education ( 14 % ) ; and women , rural dwellers and those aged 25 - 34 ( 13 % each )			1
in terms of income , the highest overall growth in smartphone use occurred in the lowest income bracket : 12 % growth among people from households earning $ 30,000 per year or less			1
nevertheless , across all age ranges , people from low - income households or who never attended college are still significantly less likely to own a smartphone			1
the slowest growth in smartphone use was among people aged 65 and over ( up only 2 % )			1
also , smartphone use grew only 5 % among blacks and @entity62 -- two groups that typically have demonstrated the greatest propensity to avidly use all the capabilities of a smartphone			2
in the bigger picture , according to @entity6 , 88 % of all @entity2 adults now own a cell phone and 46 % of all @entity2 adults now use smartphones			1
currently , 41 % of @entity2 adults use simpler " feature phones " -- which often include a web browser , e-mail , photo and video camera , and the ability to run simple apps			2
do most consumers really know whether their phone is a smartphone ? over a year ago , i did some local mobile market research ( to gauge mobile preferences here in @entity86 , @entity87 )			2
at that time , i was surprised how many people were unsure whether or not they had a smartphone			0
many assumed that if their phone had a web browser , it was a smartphone -- and similarly , many users of simple @entity15 devices did not consider them to be smartphones			1
earlier @entity6 research indicated similar consumer confusion about smartphones			0
but by now , more @entity2 cell phone owners appear to have this question sorted out			2
according to @entity6 : " as smartphone ownership has become more widespread over the last year , consumers have generally found it easier to answer questions about their phones and whether they own a smartphone or not			1
to be sure , there is still some confusion around this term as 8 % of cell owners are still not sure if their phone is a smartphone			1
" however , this is a significant decrease from the 14 % of cell owners who were not sure if their phone was a smartphone or not in may 2011			1
similarly , the proportion of cell owners who volunteered that they do n't know what type of phone they have fell from 13 % of cell owners in may 2011 to just 4 % of cell owners in february 2012			1
" of course , different sources of statistics view the smartphone / feature phone market split a bit differently			0
data from @entity121 ( which tracks the @entity2 wireless market monthly ) indicate that it wo n't be until later in 2012 that smartphones will start to comprise the majority of @entity2 handsets in use			0
what does this halfway mark in the @entity2 mobile market mean ? maybe not so much , for many people			0
certainly , more people will have devices that technically are considered smartphones -- but people with lower incomes and educational attainment will tend to lag on getting smartphones			0
also , not all smartphones are created equal			0
the low - cost android market ( particularly @entity25 phones that can be obtained for less than $ 200 on no - contract plans ) generally have slower processors , are running older versions of the @entity25 ( which may not support popular apps ) and often are harder to use or more cheaply made			0
as the @entity147 operating system becomes the norm for higher - end @entity25 devices this year , you can bet that many people with cheap @entity25 phones will still be running @entity152 , unable to upgrade			2
plus , in my experience , @entity25 phones are especially prone to cryptic , hard - to - fix technical problems -- and tech support from carriers and manufacturers is practically worthless			0
if you 're not comfortable with combing through user forums and trying fairly technical solutions , chances are you 'll just have to give up and get a new phone in a year or less			0
i 'm serious : the notorious contacts storage bug that plagues many @entity165 @entity25 phones would have rendered my @entity166 completely useless last summer , had i not decided to root my phone and install a different version of @entity25 called @entity170			0
diagnosing that problem , trying different fixes and , eventually , taking a radical solution entailed a fair amount of research and work			0
i thrive on that kind of challenge -- but i ca n't imagine most consumers doing likewise			0
finally , there 's the learning curve			0
smartphones are really hand - held computers that also happen to be able to make phone calls			2
even the pricey , slick , user - friendly @entity26 has a considerable learning curve , if you 've never had a smartphone before			2
most users of any kind of smartphone do not make use of most of what those devices can do			0
for many consumers , a smartphone will always be overkill			0
smartphones may be becoming the norm , but that does n't mean their benefits are evenly distributed			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity202 .			2

survey says " just over half of cell owners " have smartphone or use smartphone platform
biggest growth in smartphone ownership was among adults aged 18 - 24 , survey says
it says highest growth in smartphone use occurred in the lowest income bracket
@entity202 : smartphones may be becoming norm , but benefits may not be spread evenly
