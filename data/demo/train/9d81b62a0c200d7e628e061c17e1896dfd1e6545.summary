-- six months ago , @entity1 was lying in a hospital bed , recovering from a @entity4 attack in which she was shot point - blank in the head and neck			1
the shooting was meant to silence , once and for all , the outspoken @entity9 teenager who had dared to defy the @entity4 's ban against girls in school			1
but it backfired : instead of silencing the 15 - year - old , the attack only made her voice more powerful			1
@entity1 's story has raised global awareness of girls ' education , a cause she has championed for years			1
and now that she 's out of the hospital and back in school , she is determined to keep fighting for equality			0
she will be speaking at the @entity27 this summer , and her memoir is set to be published later this year			2
" @entity31 has given me this new life , " she said in february , her first public statement since the shooting			0
" i want to serve the people			0
i want every girl , every child , to be educated			0
" worldwide , there are 66 million girls out of school , according to @entity38 -- many more than boys , who do n't have to face the same discrimination and obstacles that girls do in some countries			1
after hearing of @entity1 's shooting , however , more people have become aware of the disparity and joined her fight			1
three million people across the world signed the " i am @entity1 " petition to demand universal girls ' education			1
world leaders and celebrities such as @entity56 and @entity57 have voiced their support and helped raise money for the cause			0
and in @entity9 , there have been rallies and calls for change			2
" it seems that @entity1 's courage has awoken @entity9 's silent majority who are no longer prepared to tolerate the threats and intimidations of the @entity9 @entity4 , " said former @entity66 prime minister @entity65 , a @entity27 special envoy for global education			1
@entity1 's crusade started years before the shooting , when she started writing a blog for the @entity77 about life in @entity9 's conservative @entity79			1
her father , @entity80 , continued to operated a school there despite a @entity4 edict that girls in the region are banned from getting an education			1
in her blog , @entity1 talked openly about the challenges and fears and threats her family faced			2
at first , she wrote anonymously , but she eventually became a public figure , giving on - camera interviews with @entity0 and other news outlets			0
" i have the right of education , " she said in a 2011 interview with @entity0			0
" i have the right to play			0
i have the right to sing			0
i have the right to talk			0
i have the right to go to market			0
i have the right to speak up			0
" the media attention drew the ire of the @entity4 , which says it was behind @entity1 's shooting in october			1
she was riding home in a van with some of her schoolmates when masked men stopped the vehicle and demanded to know which one of them was @entity1			2
when @entity1 was identified , the men opened fire on her and two other girls , both of whom also survived their injuries			1
" we do not tolerate people like @entity1 speaking against us , " a @entity4 spokesman said after the shooting			1
@entity1 was critically injured in the attack , but she suffered no permanent brain injuries			2
she underwent several successful surgeries in @entity9 and the @entity66 , where she now lives after her father was given a job with the @entity122			1
in march , she went back to school for the first time since the attack , attending an all - girls high school in @entity126 , @entity127			1
and while she recovers from her injuries , she is continuing to raise awareness and money for education			0
last month , she announced a $ 45,000 grant to a fund that was set up in her name -- and the first to benefit will be girls from the @entity79			0
" we are going to educate 40 girls , and i invite all of you to support the @entity142 , " @entity1 said in a video that was played at the @entity137 in @entity138			2
" let us turn the education of 40 girls into 40 million girls			2
" @entity57 , a @entity27 special envoy , will be donating $ 200,000 to the @entity142 , according to @entity137			2
the fund was set up by the @entity146 , a nongovernmental organization founded in 1997 by @entity147			0
" in parts of the @entity153 subcontinent , @entity154 and @entity155 , intimidation and violence are the daily reality of life for many girls who want to go to school and the many educators who want to teach them , " @entity65 wrote in a recent op - ed for @entity0			2
" even today , five months after @entity1 's shooting in the @entity79 , her school friends remain in fear of violence simply for attempting to return to school			1
" on july 12 , her 16th birthday , @entity1 will speak to the @entity27 about the issue			1
since her shooting , she has become the face of girls ' education , a global symbol			1
she has been nominated for the @entity174 , and last year she was selected as a runner - up for @entity177 's @entity176			0
" she is the daughter of the whole world , " her father told @entity0			0
" the world owns her			0
" more : @entity181 @entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 , 15 , has become a global symbol for girls ' education worldwide
she was shot in october by the @entity9 @entity4 , which she defied by going to school
but instead of silencing @entity1 , the shooting has only served to *strengthen* her voice
