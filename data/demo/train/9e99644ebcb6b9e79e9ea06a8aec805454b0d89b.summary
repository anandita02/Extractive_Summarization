-- thanks to several overreaching court cases , including the most well - known , the @entity4 's disastrous @entity3 decision , the past five years have given us a whole new understanding of corporate power and its intersection with " dark money " political spending			1
the price tag for elections continues to steadily rise			0
candidates and outside groups are closing in on $ 1 billion spent in the 2014 federal election cycle , and even worse , according to the @entity17 , undisclosed money has made up $ 50 million of that spending			2
luckily , the @entity19 could offer a way out of the darkness			2
a much - needed rulemaking petition to the @entity19 that would require public corporations to disclose their political spending to shareholders is receiving historic support			1
the petition has received a historic number of public comments : over 1 million as of last week			0
the @entity19 can and should act to protect investors and our democracy by creating this rule , which should be as comprehensive as possible , including direct campaign expenditures and gifts to conduit groups like the @entity38 @entity37 that play in politics			1
hardly anyone need be told that the campaign finance landscape has changed dramatically in the past three elections			0
and a big part of that story is the corporate political spending that is laundered through dark money conduits , nonprofit organizations and trade associations repurposed into political spending juggernauts with the ability to keep their donors secret			1
corporations with an aversion to disclosure have found these organizations to be the perfect vehicle for influencing elections and avoiding the wrath of consumers			2
@entity61 , a law professor and expert in this type of spending , commented ( @entity65 ) , " corporate law is ill - prepared for this new age of corporate political spending by publicly traded companies			1
today , corporate managers need not disclose to their investors -- individuals , mutual funds , or institutional investors such as government or union pension funds -- how funds from the corporate treasury are being spent , either before or after the fact			2
" and she 's right			0
although undisclosed corporate political spending has caused heartburn for transparency advocates and government watchdogs , another group of @entity38 has equal cause to fret : investors			1
investing in the @entity38 has expanded by leaps and bounds over the past few decades ; today , more than 50 million @entity38 participate in 401 ( k ) retirement savings plans through their employers			0
the 401 ( k ) system holds more than $ 2.8 trillion belonging to current employees and retirees , so when we talk about investors , we are actually talking about the public , not an elite class of shareholders			0
corporate political spending could jeopardize the retirement savings of millions of @entity38			1
gambling with a corporate brand through political spending is a high - stakes game for companies , for the people who depend on these companies to help them save , and the risks can not be overstated			1
for many middle - class @entity38 , the savings in their 401 ( k ) plans are all they have to ensure a comfortable and secure retirement			0
these people can not afford to lose their nest eggs because a company decided to gamble its name and their money on a controversial political cause			0
in addition , when a ceo chooses to use corporate money to support causes or candidates , which may be antithetical to a given shareholder political views , in essence , he or she is substituting its judgment of what candidates an investing individual should support for that of their own			1
shareholders have a right to know whether the companies they invest in are playing politics with their money , and the pending @entity19 rule could put that much - needed information in their hands			1
the @entity19 should immediately give priority to promulgating the rule requiring public corporations to disclose political spending			1
it can start by putting the petition back on the rulemaking agenda as well as by using its ongoing " disclosure review " process to recommend the rulemaking			0
as we begin to crest the wave of the next tsunami of dark and outside money of the 2014 cycle , the need for this type of transparency is blatantly apparent			0
this year , as we approach the five - year anniversary of the @entity3 decision , 1 million strong call on the @entity19 to act			2
@entity38 deserve to know who is bankrolling political advertisements , and shareholders need to know whether their investments are being wasted on politics rather than being spent on productive plans to build a better business			0
join us on @entity167 / @entity166 .			0

@entity169 : more than a million have commented on @entity19 regulation of political spending
she says it 's vital that corporations disclose political contributions they make
political donations can clash with stockholders ' views and put brands at risk , she says
@entity184 : @entity19 should give priority to *issuing* a rule that requires corporate disclosure
