-- the mortgage settlement agreed to by 49 state attorneys general seems to be yet another stroke of good luck for the banks			1
ostensibly , the settlement commits the banks to pay $ 26 billion to the government and homeowners to compensate for improper conduct in the foreclosure process			1
in the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2007 - 8 , banks and mortgage companies rushed to provide mortgage loans to homeowners , many of whom were n't capable of shouldering the debt			1
the mortgages were bundled together and sold as exotic securities to investors			0
when housing prices stopped rising and homeowners could no longer refinance their way out of bad mortgages , the cycle ended and the financial crisis set in			1
this also led to an unprecedented wave of foreclosures that continues to this day			2
if anyone expects this settlement to have a noticeable effect on the housing market , they will be badly disappointed			1
clearly , it will help some number of homeowners keep their homes , but the benefit is likely to limited			2
there are more than 10 million homeowners underwater by an average of more than $ 60,000			1
if the banks actually give $ 20 billion in debt relief as a result of this settlement , that would be sufficient to give $ 20,000 to 1 million homeowners			1
that 's helpful , but little more than a drop in the bucket			0
the settlement covers a wide range of sins committed by banks and other mortgage lenders			1
in some cases , it was simply an issue of sloppy paperwork			0
that may not seem like that big of a deal , but anyone who has taken out a mortgage and had to pay a lawyer several hundred dollars to ensure that the paperwork was in order might not appreciate rules saying that big banks are not bound by the same law			1
if there 's no evidence of deliberate fraud , banks will be given immunity from responsibility for sloppy paperwork			0
a second set of sins involved more substantive violations where servicers attached fees improperly or foreclosed without proper notice			0
the banks treated foreclosure as a mass production operation			0
in many cases , this might have meant imposing penalties that they did not have a right to impose or push through foreclosures without going through all the necessary steps			0
the third and most serious issue involved foreclosures where banks could not prove that they owned the property			2
this may seem farfetched , but there are foreclosure cases in which the bank 's servicer lacked the documentation to show that it in fact owned the property			0
in some of the famous cases of robo - signing , people were being paid to forge documents to substitute for ones that could not be found			0
we do n't know whether the number of cases where mortgage servicers could not produce the documentation to establish ownership of the house were few or many			2
this is an issue that is likely not to be investigated as a result of the settlement			0
presumably servicers will at least have to produce proper documentation going forward			0
while $ 26 billion sounds like a substantial sum , we do n't know at this point how much of this will the banks actually pay			1
most of the payment will take the form of modifications and debt write - offs in short sales			0
there is no easy way to determine how much the banks will pay through this route because we do n't know what debt write - offs they would have done in the absence of the settlement			1
if the banks are allowed to count every dollar written off as a dollar against the settlement -- as though they would have made no write - offs otherwise -- then it is possible that they wo n't pay a dime for this settlement			1
we also do n't know how much the banks will pay because most of the write - offs are likely to be on mortgage - backed securities that they are servicing , not on mortgages that they own			1
this means that they will be paying their penalty with investors ' money			0
if this is not a legal first , it is certainly unusual to have a settlement where the defendant is able to pay using someone else 's money			2
it would have been useful if the attorneys general had pushed for a settlement that gave enforceable rights to homeowners facing foreclosure			2
for example , if they had required servicers to give every foreclosed homeowner the right to stay in their home paying the market rent for five years following a foreclosure , millions of homeowners would have immediately been given housing security they currently lack			1
and , they could enforce this one themselves rather than relying on the goodwill of the bank or government overseers			0
but , that does n't seem about to happen given the political power of the banks			2
it looks like their good luck is continuing			0
