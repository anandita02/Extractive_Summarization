-- should @entity1 -- or anyone , for that matter -- lose a job because of marital infidelity ? four experts weigh in			1
@entity7 : stop being the morality police it 's " @entity10 " all over again			1
when will @entity11 realize that an active libido has no effect on how someone runs a government agency ? how many leaders in the past -- whether it 's in politics , business or other settings -- have done a fine job in spite of having an extramarital affair ? we need to cease being the morality police and accept the fact that we 're all human beings			2
what 's more , in the uniform code of military justice , adultery can be deemed a crime			1
as long as such archaic laws are part of any justice system , it makes it impossible to move out of the dark ages			0
we are living in a society where over half of all marriages end in divorce			0
why should it surprise anyone that adultery is commonplace ? the best thing the arbiters of decency and good taste can do is to stay out of other people 's lives			1
the greatest right that any nation can afford its people is the right to be left alone			0
@entity7 , a prominent advocate of first amendment rights , is chairman of the @entity56 brand , which includes adult magazines , broadcasting , @entity59 , retail , gaming and entertainment businesses			1
@entity63 : our amnesia about adultery should @entity1 have had to resign over an affair ? we 've all been reading about legendary @entity71 director @entity70 ' multiple flagrant affairs , so if you turn to history for an answer , no. but adultery matters more now than it did in @entity70 ' day , and there 's more of a social need to rake people over the coals for it			1
thus we have to keep developing amnesia about how common adultery is , and about the previous 10 adultery scandals , so that we can be outraged all over again			2
society needs its scapegoats , and unfortunately @entity1 offered himself up for the role			1
this is an incredibly pleasurable scandal			0
first , it 's a classic downfall story , replete with powerful warriors and vengeful females -- there 's something satisfying about familiar myths like this playing out in actual life			1
this scandal also has so much narrative complexity : it 's a cautionary tale about unintended consequences and people not foreseeing the effects of their actions ( @entity101 's e-mails , @entity102 contacting her @entity104 pal , not to mention the affair itself , though these days that 's obviously not so newsworthy on its own )			1
you ca n't help wondering what elements of your own life could unravel as quickly following some misguided impulse			0
at the same time , you get to feel superior about the terrible judgment and irrationality of supposedly rational people			2
and of course it confirms a lot of stereotypes we 're supposed to have put aside , about catfights , spurned destructive women , and the younger woman - aging wife problem , all of which runs counter to the various enlightened and progressive things we 're supposed to think and say about gender			0
there 's been much hypocrisy on this			2
you have all the news outlets running @entity101 's picture next to @entity136 ' , more or less saying : draw your own conclusions			2
then a few days later they 're all running finger - wagging articles ( e.g. @entity139 in the @entity140 ) rebuking the other news outlets for focusing on @entity101 's appearance and " well - toned arms			2
" my own view is that given @entity101 's tendency to showcase her physique in public appearances , it 's a legitimate part of the story			2
finally , there 's always a certain satisfaction in exposing the powerful and purportedly virtuous			1
it confirms a cynical view of the world , that behind closed doors everyone is up to something untoward			0
@entity63 is the author of " how to become a scandal : adventures in @entity160 " ( @entity161 )			1
@entity162 : no cover - up in the digital age the resignation under fire of @entity1 is many things : a global media circus , a made - for - cable - @entity170 reality soap opera , a professional disintegration , a bizarre and sad spectacle			1
on one level , it is also unfair , since there is no proof yet that @entity1 violated any laws in his private personal conduct			1
and if perpetual moral chastity were a strict requirement for public office , @entity180 would be a ghost town filled with chirping crickets , tumbleweed and empty offices			0
but @entity1 did occupy the most sensitive and potentially high - risk job in @entity11 , and there are concerns -- not yet verified , to be sure -- that sensitive information may have passed to his mistress			1
from a national security risk perspective , and because of the dangers of blackmail or influence by foreign powers , it 's not too much for the @entity11 people to expect from a @entity71 director that he or she suspend such third - party relationships while in the post			0
i interviewed @entity1 a while back for my book			1
like many others , i found him to be very helpful , responsive and enthusiastic , even though i believed that he did not turn the @entity206 around in 2007 , but rather built on the momentum already established by capt. @entity208 and his @entity210 and @entity211 colleagues the year before			0
i am sorry to see @entity1 go because he seems to be a very capable man for the job			2
@entity1 was @entity11 's first great digital general			1
he was the ultimate " @entity215 " -- the nickname given by military officers to colleagues adept at giving dazzling digital presentations overflowing with data , graphics and bullet points			0
he was an inveterate e-mailer , famously accessible to journalists , historians and writers at all hours			0
so it 's not surprising that he was brought down by a chain of e-mails			1
perhaps @entity1 and his former colleague gen. @entity230 were addicted to e-mails on some level , but in jobs like theirs , sloppiness can be fatal			1
in the digital age where everything seems to have a trail , there is really no escape , no appeal and no cover - up			0
there 's been a lot of talk from @entity1 ' supporters that he did the honorable thing by quitting			1
the truth is , given his job and the digital world we live in , he had no choice			0
@entity162 is author of " a soldier 's dream : captain @entity208 and the @entity255 " ( @entity256 ) and co-author of " a mission from @entity259 : a memoir and @entity261 " ( @entity262 )			1
@entity263 and @entity264 : resignation was honorable , necessary @entity1 is by equal account an honorable man , a great patriot and one of the most important generals in recent @entity11 history			1
so was it really necessary for our country to lose one of its brightest intellects in the top spy job just because he had an affair ? ca n't you hear the laughter coming from @entity281 or @entity282 , where the reaction to discovery of a mistress or even a child out of wedlock is @entity288 © ? @entity1 ' resignation was as honorable as it was necessary			2
he did n't lose his job over infidelity			0
he had to either resign or be fired because he exercised poor judgment			1
@entity1 ' surreptitious extramarital affair was investigated for fear he might have been the target of blackmail or revealed national secrets			2
as a long - time @entity180 insider , @entity1 was no naif about the consequences if the affair became public			2
the moment the man in charge of the world 's most powerful spy agency engaged in the affair , he took a risk that had repercussions well beyond his personal life			2
his self - indulgence invited an inevitable media circus that has undermined his credibility and distracted his organization at the critical moment it faces an inquiry into the september attack on the @entity11 @entity319 in @entity320 , @entity321			0
@entity1 knew that his ability to stand tall before his co-workers at the @entity71 , the @entity324 or the @entity11 people had been compromised			2
to enable the @entity71 to get on with its business , he accepted the need to step aside so that his personal life did n't become the focus			0
organizations are built on trust and shared values			0
when leaders exercise bad judgment and take actions that risk the well - being of their constituents -- even if it happens in their personal life and is not criminal -- they compromise that trust and have to go			0
in the business world , @entity338 or top leaders at @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 have lost their jobs in recent months because of sexual affairs			0
most companies have explicit rules or require disclosure of relationships within a company			0
these policies are to protect employees from managers who might leverage their power to sexually harass subordinates or engage in favoritism , creating intolerable work environments			0
such rules apply to all employees , but these business leaders failed to acknowledge their affairs			0
some simply kept secrets from their boards of directors , while others took deliberate steps to conceal them , no doubt to protect their reputations and marriages			0
to @entity1 ' credit , he reportedly never asked for special treatment and knew that public knowledge of his lapse in judgment would inevitably lead to his removal			1
let 's applaud @entity1 and thank him for his invaluable service to our country			1
as @entity11 , we seem to love redemption stories and have been so often willing to give our leaders a second chance after they demonstrate their fallibility			0
@entity1 will no doubt resurface in coming years and , we hope , continue to contribute to our nation 's welfare			1
it just wo n't be at the @entity71			0
@entity263 and @entity264 are co-authors of " @entity390 : how @entity391 by trusting their people			1
" they have advised ceos around the world and worked with @entity396 , @entity397 , @entity398 and @entity399 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0
