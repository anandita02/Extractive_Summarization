one doctor says the study " very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine			2
" a new study published in the january 2008 issue of @entity6 found the prevalence of autism cases in @entity10 children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury - based preservative thimerosal in 1999 , suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder			1
researchers from the @entity17 found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007			2
the preservative , thimerosal , has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001 , except for some flu shots			1
the latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups , who have long blamed mercury , a neurotoxin , for the disorder			0
for years , parents have been concerned that a mercury - containing vaccine preservative may play a role in autism			2
but a study conducted in @entity10 found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines			1
the study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism , although advocacy groups say it 's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected			1
do these findings suggest that autism is n't linked to mercury in vaccines ? dr. @entity45 , chief medical correspondent : let me explain			1
in 1999 , manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury - based preservative - from vaccines			1
some people believed autism would decrease as a result , because they thought the two were connected			2
a new study in the @entity6 says this just did n't happen			2
researchers looked at cases of autism in @entity10 after 1999			1
they reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism , the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed			1
from 2004 to 2007 , when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3 - to 5 - year - olds , the autism rate continued to go up , from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in @entity10			1
a child psychiatrist who supported the study said it " very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine			2
" but advocacy groups say it 's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines			1
the @entity78 says the study does n't include children under the age of 3 , which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines			1
it says thimerosal was n't completely off the shelves until 2002 or 2003			1
their main point is that mercury is a neurotoxin , so why take a chance by putting it in vaccines ? what do scientists think causes autism ? as many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism , and doctors still do n't know why			1
doctors point to genetics and environment as culprits , but it could be more complicated than that			0
the latest research shows these children are not necessarily born with autism but with the potential to develop it			0
what exactly are these outside factors ? it 's hard to pinpoint			0
what we eat , what we breathe , what we drink -- all these things could play a role			0
some doctors say the increase is due to a change in the way the condition is diagnosed kids who were once labeled mentally retarded are now being labeled as autistic			0
what are possible signs of autism in your child ? doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months			0
some red flags that indicate your child may have autism : no babbling or pointing by 12 months , no single words by 16 months , no brief phrases by 24 months , loss of language or social skills			0
if you see any of these signs , the @entity143 recommends seeing a pediatric neurologist , developmental pediatrician or child psychologist			0
what led companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines to begin with ? several things pushed companies in this direction			1
over the past decade , more and more attention was given to the health effects of mercury on humans			0
and then in the ' 90s , the @entity159 added new vaccines to the list of routine shots that children should get			0
some of them used thimerosal as a preservative			0
this was happening while the government was trying to decrease our exposure to mercury			0
so the @entity172 began looking into the issue			0
in 1997 , @entity174 passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury , which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later .			2

removal of thimerosal from most vaccines has n't reduced the number of autism cases diagnosed in the state of @entity10 .
