@entity0 is living proof that life is full of second chances			1
the former @entity4 governor of @entity5 , whose political career was left for dead along the @entity7 after an extramarital affair , asked for , and tuesday received , political redemption as he won a special election to fill a vacant @entity12 seat that he once occupied			1
" i want to acknowledge a @entity16 not just of second chances but third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh , eighth chances , because that is the reality of our shared humanity , " @entity0 said at his victory celebration after defeating his @entity15 opponent , @entity14			1
" i am one imperfect man saved by @entity16 's grace			0
" 5 things we learned from @entity0 's win and at a news conference minutes later , @entity0 added that " i think we 're always on the search for redemption and i think this is certainly a degree of political redemption			1
" @entity0 , who won 54 % to 45 % , according to an unofficial vote count in @entity5 's 1st @entity32 , made reference to his political baggage from his infamous affair			1
" if it was just about market - based ideas and limited government , this campaign would have easily won a long time ago			0
but i had deficiencies that are well chronicled as a candidate and at the end of the day i was carried across the threshold , if you will , by an incredible team of volunteers			0
" @entity14 , an official with @entity47 's wind turbine drive testing facility who was best known nationally as the sister of satirist and @entity52 host @entity51 , said that , " the people have spoken and i respect their decision			1
" but she added that " we gave it a heck of fight " and assured supporters that " i will continue to fight for the people of @entity5			0
" @entity0 won all five counties in the district , including @entity64 and @entity65 , home to @entity67 , where some @entity15 hoped that older voters would be turned off by @entity0 's scandals and just stay home			1
in @entity64 , @entity0 's home base but the @entity15 ' best hope as well , he narrowly edged out @entity14			1
@entity14 won absentee ballots , but it was n't nearly enough to carry her to victory			2
@entity0 : primary win was ' a big referendum ' on comeback effort " turnout was very large for a special election -- roughly a quarter of the 18 - plus population voted , more than 140,000 votes total , " said @entity81 polling director @entity80 , who analyzed the vote			1
" that seems to have helped @entity0			2
low turnout would have meant a lot of republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and would n't vote for a @entity91			0
high turnout turns that around : plenty of @entity4 who had misgivings about @entity0 came out to vote anyway			1
" @entity0 's oldest son @entity95 and his now - @entity100 © e @entity97 were standing beside the candidate at his victory celebration			1
" she flew a continent to be here last night			0
whether i won or lost , she wanted to be here , " @entity0 said wednesday mornign on @entity81 's " @entity104			1
" " we certainly appreciate her willing to do so , and i think as folks get to know her , i think they 're going to love her			0
" @entity0 was in his second term as governor in 2009 when he disappeared from public view for several days			2
at the time his staff claimed he 'd been hiking the @entity7			0
he later admitted that he was actually in @entity115 , seeing @entity116 , with whom he was having an affair			0
the episode sank any hopes @entity0 had of making a bid for the 2012 @entity4 presidential nomination			2
@entity0 and wife @entity122 were divorced in 2010			2
he finished his second term as governor in january 2011 , after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations , exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity			0
but he came back , beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the @entity4 nomination in the race for the vacant @entity12 seat			0
from the start , @entity0 was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first tv ad			1
and even with all his political baggage , he was considered the favorite in the race until last month , when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against @entity0 for trespassing on her property			1
@entity0 told @entity81 that he did n't want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away			2
he 's scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election			0
not long after the trespassing story broke , the @entity149 announced it was pulling out of the race and national @entity15 groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest			2
and national democratic groups jumped in			0
the @entity156 and independent @entity157 combined dished out nearly $ 1 million to defeat @entity0			2
the two groups , as well as @entity14 , highlighted the affair			1
at their only general election debate , @entity14 brought up @entity0 's 2009 secret trip to @entity115 to see his mistress			1
" when we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers , it does n't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose , " she said sternly , looking directly at her opponent on stage			0
in @entity5 politics , two very different campaign styles and her campaign went up with a tv commercial which slammed @entity0 for using " tax dollars to visit his mistress in @entity115 , disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge , betrayed all who trusted him , then lied to cover it up			2
@entity0 , it 's a question of character			1
" the @entity156 and @entity157 have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads. " i used to be for @entity0 , but not any more			1
he skipped town to be with his mistress on @entity193			0
@entity0 even asked his wife for permission to have the affair , " said @entity194			2
pleasant @entity4 voter @entity198 in the @entity157 commercial			0
but over the past month , another woman also entered the campaign spotlight : @entity12 minority leader @entity202			2
@entity0 and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie @entity14 to @entity202 , saying that a vote for @entity14 would also be a vote for @entity202 , who has high negatives with @entity4 voters and who most likely would become @entity12 speaker again if the @entity15 run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year 's midterm elections			1
opinion : @entity215 politicians find new life after disgrace " i 've fought hard over the years to make @entity5 a better place to call home			0
but those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country			0
maybe that 's why @entity202 and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me			2
but this contest is bigger than them or me , it 's about two different visions of how we restore @entity234 and reign in @entity236 spending , " @entity0 said , looking into the camera in a tv spot that started running district - wide last week			1
two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of @entity202 to call out @entity14 for not accepting more than one debate			1
@entity0 also repeatedly brought up the money that national @entity15 groups have poured into the @entity5 race			1
" what it says is , whose voice do you carry when you go to @entity236 ? " he said in the debate with @entity14 , pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national @entity15 groups have spent on the race			1
@entity14 , responding to the @entity0 criticism , sought to distance herself from @entity236 and from national @entity15			1
" no one tells me what to do except the people of @entity5 's 1st @entity32			0
so a victory for @entity14 is a victory for the people of @entity5 's 1st @entity32 , " she told @entity81 monday , adding that two - thirds of her contributions have come from within the @entity5			2
while @entity0 touted his fiscal conservative record , @entity257 campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck president @entity260			0
in her @entity81 interview , she highlighted where she does n't see eye to eye with the president			0
" i respectfully disagree with his budget , " she said , adding that " we need to vote to repair " the president 's health care law			0
even though they did n't support @entity0 , the @entity149 congratulated him tuesday night , and said the results could prove troublesome for @entity12 @entity15 in 2014			0
" democrats spent more than $ 1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the @entity91 machine , but at the end of the day , running on the @entity260 - @entity202 ticket was just too toxic for @entity14 , " rep. @entity271 , @entity149 chairman , said in a statement			1
but national @entity15 see a silver lining in @entity14 's defeat			1
" @entity281 ' outreach to women voters now has @entity0 as the face			0
republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until @entity287 , " rep. @entity284 , @entity156 chairman , said in a statement			0
" in this deep red @entity4 district that @entity290 won by 18 points , the fact that the @entity91 made this competitive is a testament to the strength of @entity14 as a candidate and the @entity4 habit of nominating flawed candidates			2
" @entity0 has a woman problem the congressional seat became vacant when rep. @entity299 , who won re-election by 27 percentage points last november , was picked by @entity4 gov. @entity302 to fill the @entity304 seat of sen. @entity305 , who stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the conservative @entity307			0
no @entity91 has held the seat in more than 30 years , and that streak still stands .			0
