-- the images coming from @entity2 over the past few weeks have been arresting : troops shooting , protesters hurling rocks , people bleeding			1
just like the tear gas that clouds the scenes in photos , a complete picture of the truth in the confrontations is also hazy			2
allegations of censorship , self - censorship and photo manipulation have made it difficult for news consumers -- especially @entity2 -- to form a complete picture of what is going on			1
a media blackout has stymied the flow of information during some of the most intense days of clashes between anti-government protesters and authorities			1
in addition , strict regulations have pressured media outlets to tread softly when it comes to covering the violence			2
there is more freedom on social media , but there are accusations that these channels of communication have been polluted by fake photos and misinformation			1
and the government allegedly blocked access to @entity44 during protests last week			2
" people do n't know what is happening and they depend on the dangerous or beneficial social networks because on social media , you can get truthful information			1
but also you can find people who misinform for their own ends , " said @entity52 , a journalist for a @entity54 - based news startup that was created specifically to fill the gaps in coverage in @entity2			1
@entity60 , the network 's user - generated platform , has received more than 2,700 submissions from @entity2 in the past week			1
of those , more than 120 have been verified by producers and cleared for @entity0			2
these are developments that mostly have not been making it on to @entity2 newscasts			1
one vetted @entity60 video begins by showing a contrast : president @entity72 speaking on television about how things are under control , while outside a window , national guard troops are firing tear gas			0
as he filmed , @entity79 said the troops " aimed at me but since i live on the 14th floor i did n't think they could reach , but i was wrong			0
" a tear gas canister broke through a window and landed under a sofa , @entity83 said			0
his brother managed to throw the canister back out the window , but not before their 85 - year - old father suffered from the gas			2
in the western state of @entity97 , in the city of @entity95 , @entity93 captured video of student protesters " trying to be heard " by blocking streets and burning debris that cast an orange glow on them			0
these reports provide under - reported vantage points , but what is the whole story ? it is a challenge when unverified content is going viral and a government is blocking media			1
media blackouts the ongoing protests grabbed the world 's attention on february 12 , when two anti-government protesters and one government supporter were killed			2
the day before , according to @entity119 , the state broadcasting authority warned that coverage of the violence could violate a controversial law that prohibits the broadcasting of material that " foments anxiety " or " incites or promotes hatred and intolerance for ... political reasons			0
" as bullets flew and people died on the 12th , most outlets heeded the warning			0
the @entity134 monitored 38 radio stations the day of the killings and found that only five reported on developments in the day 's deadly violence and 30 transmitted " light programming			0
the other three echoed the government 's position			0
the media silence " denied the citizenry the right to information of public interest and of relevancy for the safety of residents in the cities where the demonstrations unfolded , " the institute said in a report			1
watch : violence in @entity155 on february 12 comedian @entity156 , who also hosts a radio and television program , was among the majority who were silent on the airwaves on the violent day			0
the next day , he apologized to his listeners and said he was ashamed of @entity2 media			1
@entity156 told @entity164 that he understands the restrictions the media is working under , but " this does n't help at all for the panorama to become clearer and for peace to be achieved as quickly as possible			2
" how could it be , he asked , that while clashes were taking a turn toward violence , all one could find on television was a cooking show about how to fry eggs ? " i wanted to express myself as one more @entity2 in my pain that the ( national ) media was not providing the coverage that i wanted about what is happening in @entity2 , " @entity156 said			1
" having to inform ourselves through foreign press is shameful			0
" photo manipulation social media is playing a vital role in the current unrest as an unfiltered channel for sharing images of protests and alleged abuses			1
government supporters are trying to cast doubt on the credibility of photos shared by the opposition by launching its own campaign to uncover what they say is manipulation of images			0
websites and social media users who support the government are circulating a number of examples of images that the opposition claims to be from the @entity2 clashes , but are actually file photos from other events			1
a photo of a student in a headlock by a soldier in @entity219 in 2011 , for example , has been shared by opposition members to misrepresent the current violence in @entity2 , government supporters say			1
@entity2 actress @entity222 apologized to her 228,000 @entity44 followers after she shared a photo allegedly showing police forcing a protester to perform oral sex on them			1
the original image came from a @entity231 porn site , a pro-government website said			0
another tweeter , to show the size of the support for the anti-government movement , shared a photo of a long human chain stretching out along a highway in @entity97			0
but the photo appears to have been published originally last year in a @entity241 newspaper and actually depicts protesters in @entity241			0
the examples of manipulated photos are but a drop in the fire hose of images being shared on social media , but sometimes that is all that 's needed to sow seeds of doubt			2
the government 's position @entity72 's government makes its own claims -- that the protesters are in cahoots with the @entity231 , that there is coup in the works , that the opposition is behind the deaths -- but rarely offers evidence or elaborates			0
the accusations find space on state - owned media , and the government complains that other outlets are biased against it			1
in an interview with @entity0 en @entity271 , @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity273 , @entity274 , accused international media , including @entity0 , of bias in its coverage			1
reflecting on the protests , he said , " we are expecting the democratic evolution of these events , of which there has been very little coverage of the government position			0
" the government had already initiated a dialogue with the opposition , including meetings with opposition mayors and governors			0
" but that 's not news , " @entity274 said			0
" what 's news is a car lit on fire , or a death blamed on the government or the opposition in these clashes			0
" the cameras are focusing on police on the streets , and not on the protesters who throw rocks or @entity308 cocktails , he said			0
@entity44 troubles it 's not been just the content , but access to social media that has been a roadblock to gathering information			1
those who have taken to social media accused the government of blocking access to @entity44 last week			2
hundreds of @entity44 users in @entity2 reported difficulties using the service , and a @entity44 representative confirmed that images posted on @entity44 were being blocked in the country			1
the @entity2 broadcasting regulator denied that the government interfered			1
@entity2 's minister of communications , @entity328 , also used @entity44 -- to bash @entity44 users			1
" social media is being used by violent coup plotters to create anxiety in the public in a psychological operation of great scale , " she said			2
" powerful media laboratories are being employed to advance a psychological war without precedent against @entity2			1
" telling fact from fiction telling the whole story in @entity2 is not a new challenge			1
the government 's clampdown on private media has left little room for views outside of the official line			2
@entity2 journalists in @entity54 created a new channel that streams online called @entity351			1
it was slated to go live next week , but the protests caused it to move up its debut			0
many of the journalists on board are considered " opposition journalists " by the @entity2 government , but they say their goal is to present unbiased journalism			1
the government has an invitation to come on their air anytime , its journalists say			0
@entity0 also goes through great lengths to verify the ireports that are submitted			0
producers speak to the person who uploaded the @entity60 , check metadata and cross-verify whether the image is original , fact check any allegations , and add additional context and reporting as needed			2
in one extreme case , a violent video that depicts protesters and officials clashing took more than 10 hours to fact check and approve			0
the effort was worth it , said @entity384 , director of social media for @entity0 en @entity271			2
" it ´ s an amazing @entity60			0
the best one i have ever seen on the platform			0
" @entity0 's @entity390 , @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 and @entity394 contributed to this report .			0

getting an *honest* picture of the unrest in @entity2 has its challenges
there are allegations of censorship , self - censorship and misinformation
there has been a media blackout in @entity2 , some say
lots of information flows online , but lots of it has not been verified
