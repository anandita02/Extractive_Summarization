-- was it the end of the world at the summer box office ? there certainly was plenty of destruction to go around			2
not only were several cities destroyed , including @entity10 ( " @entity12 " ) and @entity11 ( " @entity13 " ) , there was also the kind of destruction @entity16 hates : that of their receipts			2
summer ticket sales , as of the last week in august , were down 15 % over summer 2013 , according to the @entity21 , quoting movie business tabulator @entity22			1
for movies released in the may - august window , grosses were down a whopping 25 % -- $ 3.67 billion this year vs. $ 4.85 billion last year , according to boxofficemojo.com			1
nonetheless , with the exceptions of " @entity29 " and a handful of others , there was an " eh " feeling to much of what hit the multiplex between may and august of this year			2
@entity35 carnage , gross - out comedy , comic - book saviors : have n't we seen this movie before ? consider this : 2014 was the first summer since 2001 in which there was no movie that topped $ 300 million domestically			1
studios like to tout $ 200 million as a blockbuster benchmark , but $ 300 million is real high - flying territory : " @entity48 , " the " @entity50 " films , " @entity51 , " films with what they call " legs , " that create return business and draw in some lukewarm moviegoers			1
( to be fair , " guardians " may still get there			0
) as @entity62 ' @entity61 notes , there were various reasons for the down summer , and not all of them were bad : some planned films were rescheduled , and others were aimed as much at overseas markets as at the @entity70			1
( the mediocre " @entity72 " barely cracked $ 200 million in the @entity70 but earned another $ 500 million in international markets			1
) still , the results provide a great deal of food for thought			0
here are a few points to ponder : 1			0
do n't reach for the stars			1
@entity79 ( " @entity83 " ) , @entity80 ( " blended " ) and @entity81 ( " @entity82 " ) could n't carry their respective movies to blockbuster territory			1
only @entity86 ( " @entity87 " ) succeeded , with @entity88 ( " @entity89 " ) getting an honorable mention			0
however , it might be worth it to keep an eye on @entity94 , the up - and - coming light of " @entity96			1
" sure , the film was based on a beloved book , but the film 's success caught many observers by surprise -- and @entity94 was at the center of it all			0
with her previous turn in the equally successful " @entity106 , " she 's coming on strong			0
blow it up good ! as mentioned , destruction was high on @entity16 's list , especially when @entity110 is involved			0
the @entity115 - directed " @entity114 " stomped on the planet again , " @entity113 " ( produced by @entity110 ) did some damage and " @entity12 " visited @entity10			1
but more than destruction , apocalypse was in the air : witness " @entity83 , " " @entity120 " and " @entity121 : anarchy			0
" and we go to the movies to escape from real life ? 3			0
only two movies topped $ 100 million domestically among comedies this summer : " neighbors , " with the sneaky , shambling @entity129 , and " 22 jump street			1
" the latter was an interesting twist on the sequel , a follow - up that knew it was a follow - up and took every opportunity to make that the source of the comedy			2
( in going along for the ride , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 were excellent self - parodies			2
) but " @entity82 " performed tepidly ( though some may disagree ) , " @entity145 " found one more way to go and " @entity144 " was erased			0
you know what they say : dying is easy , comedy is hard			0
who needs the @entity70 ? " transformers " had a relatively mediocre turnout in @entity70 , grossing less than $ 250 million -- good enough to become the no. 2 film of the summer , but only no. 4 among the four " transformers " films			1
on the other hand , overseas the film picked up $ 821 million -- including more than $ 300 million in @entity159 , becoming that country 's highest - grossing film of all time			1
that was no accident : @entity159 is the second biggest film market in the world , and @entity16 is catering to it more and more			1
perhaps the most talked - about film of the summer -- at least in markets where it has played -- is " boyhood , " @entity175 's ode to one child 's growing up			2
@entity175 took a risk in deciding to follow his protagonist , played by @entity179 , and his other actors for 12 years , trusting that a film shot over that time would come together			0
it worked beautifully , with a 99 % critics ' approval on @entity186 and early @entity188 talk			0
in the past , watching someone age in a film was a sociological curiosity : witness @entity193 's " @entity196 " films , which have revisited a group of students every seven years			2
now that we 're in the @entity200 age , in which every part of our lives is put on video , it 'll be interesting to see if @entity175 's concept becomes more normalized .			0

no movie topped $ 300 million , but there were no " @entity208 " - level flops , either
stars were n't big *drivers* to films ; concepts were
@entity159 market made " transformers " a blockbuster
