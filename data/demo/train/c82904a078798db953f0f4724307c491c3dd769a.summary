-- it started out life as a new video game concept but quickly morphed into a prototype with a far more practical vision -- a haptic device to help the blind and visually impaired			1
@entity8 is a wrist - mounted device which informs the wearer about the proximity of objects in complex environments , according to its creator @entity14			1
ultrasonic sensors positioned at the front measure distances from one inch up to 10 feet ( 2cm to 3.5m ) , @entity14 says , while motorized rubber pads at the rear apply increasing amounts of pressure on the wrist as users get closer to an object			1
the original idea was rather different			2
@entity14 wanted to create a " dungeon crawl " game ( a type of fantasy role - playing adventure set in labyrinths ) that did n't rely on vision			1
so he built a haptic headband complete with sensors and vibration motors			1
it worked , but there was a problem			0
he kept crashing into things that were n't at head height and the vibrations drove him batty , he says			0
moving the remodeled device to the back of his hand not only saved him a lot of stubbed toes , but also steered the project in its new direction			1
the prototype is powered by a standard nine volt battery and can be worn on either hand			0
it 's cheap too , with materials totaling around $ 75 , @entity14 says			2
so far , tests with the blind have been very positive , he says , and it 's attracting interest from educators , designers and researchers in the field			0
@entity64 , principle manager of digital accessibility at the @entity67 's @entity66 thinks the device shows promise			2
" orientation and mobility are critical skills for a blind person 's independence , education , employment and quality of life			0
electronic orientation devices , such as @entity8 have the potential to enable individuals to move around independently and gain confidence , " @entity64 said			1
@entity82 - based @entity14 is currently working on reducing @entity8 's size as well as improving its accuracy and simplifying its construction			1
" it 's not perfect , but it works , and it can be better , " @entity14 said			0
" it could easily be made about half the size , and the replaceable batteries should be replaced by rechargeables with a blind - friendly charging method -- either a wireless or magnetically - aligning power plug			2
" " one of the biggest and best criticisms is that it is very difficult for a blind person to build their own			0
i hope to address that in a future version , " he said			0
@entity14 has released details of @entity8 's materials , circuits and software on his @entity108 web site under a @entity109 license to maximise feedback and hopefully improve the design			1
" there are a number of improvements and changes left to be made			0
i 'm curious to see what happens , " he said .			0

@entity82 - based *inventor* devises cheap haptic device to help visually impaired
" @entity8 " uses sensors which measure distances from one inch to 10 feet
rubber pads apply more pressure as a user gets closer to an object
