@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a powerful @entity4 leader , looks out at the icy @entity5 stretched out under a fuzzy orange sun that refuses to set this time of year			1
" this is our garden , " said the former mayor of the @entity9 , a county - style government covering an area as big as @entity13			2
@entity3 's garden , the @entity5 , is filled with the whales , seals , walruses and fish the @entity20 still need to survive			0
but many @entity20 think " their garden " is being threatened by an international oil rush to get at what may be a treasure trove of more than 25 billion barrels of crude			1
@entity3 's lynchpin decision on whether to fight @entity30 's efforts to begin exploratory drilling in the @entity5 was among the most difficult of his 67 years			1
running his hands along the edge of a traditional boat -- much like the @entity20 people have used for thousands of years to hunt whale -- @entity3 remembers environmental oil disasters such as 1989 's @entity38 and the @entity39			1
but he also talks about the critical economic needs of the region 's 9,500 people -- 11 % of whom live below the poverty line			0
" i struggled with myself and prayed a lot , " says @entity3			0
the whole world is watching			0
just ask @entity48 , an eco-journalist and author of " the @entity4 and the @entity50			0
" " if @entity30 really hits it big this summer , i think things will heat up even more , " @entity48 told @entity2			1
" it will be an undersea gold rush for oil			1
" shortly before @entity3 left office after serving a maximum term , he reached a compromise with @entity30 that opened the door for drilling to begin later this year			1
other officials have struggled with competing fears and desires linked to the promise of oil riches			2
opinion : why we should look toward the @entity5 what 's interesting about @entity3 's shift toward his final decision is how far he traveled			0
in his own words , @entity3 moved from " hell no " to " ok			2
" " not only no ... but hell no ! " @entity3 emphasizes			2
" even one time i said , ' i 'm going to fight this , and they will have to do it over my dead body			0
' " in this age of polarized politics and unwavering ideology , you have to wonder : what was that internal journey like ? @entity3 is no stranger to the oil industry			2
he spent some time working as a roustabout in @entity1 's @entity83 , the nation 's largest oil field			1
but @entity3 viewed @entity30 's plan at first as " another threat to our way of life up here			1
" " we are the @entity5 , because we are the land , we are the ocean we are one and the same , " says @entity3			0
" that 's how we look at our environment -- how our culture has managed to get to this day and age , through thousands of years in one of the harshest environments			0
" proponents say if @entity30 finds oil , it could spark thousands of new jobs			1
as much as 27 billion barrels could be waiting to be pumped to the surface , according to federal estimates , and 132 trillion cubic feet of natural gas			0
opponents say an oil spill could pollute the waters and damage the economy			2
" our subsistence for the winter , it all comes from the ocean , the fish and whale			0
it 's going to ruin our ocean , " said 79 - year - old @entity117 of @entity118 , @entity1			1
@entity30 vows it 's taken every step possible to avoid a catastrophe			1
" we will be drilling these wells like they are the most complex , most difficult wells that we have drilled in company history , " says @entity124 , the vice president of @entity30			1
@entity30 , he says , has to " take measures to safeguard the culture , the subsistence hunt and the lifestyle the people enjoy			1
" the company plans to use drilling ships to root for oil in two areas : a site west of @entity0 named @entity139 in the @entity140 and to the east of @entity0 in the @entity142 at a spot designated as @entity144			1
about 18 miles offshore in the @entity142 and 70 miles in the @entity140 , in water less than 200 feet deep , the ships will drill about 8,000 feet to collect data on potential oil reserves			1
then workers will seal the wells with cement and mechanical plugs before permanently abandoning them			0
the 2010 bp deepwater horizon spill that killed 11 oil workers and lasted three months spewed from a well that was 5,000 feet under water and about 40 miles off shore			2
the @entity5 's shallow waters will make a @entity159 scenario less likely , supporters say , because getting to the well will be easier and pressure conditions underwater at the drill site will be more favorable			0
@entity30 has been forced to postpone drilling , which was scheduled to begin this month , until august by an unexpectedly thick ice pack			1
the delay cuts valuable time for @entity30 , which is operating under @entity169 permits that require the company to stop drilling in the seas by the end of october			1
on saturday , one of the ships that @entity30 plans to use to drill slipped its mooring and drifted close to one of @entity1 's @entity179			1
it was the latest in a string of incidents to arise around the controversial project			0
questions also were raised in june about the durability of one of @entity30 's underwater oil spill containment vessels in severe weather , which resulted in the vessel that was headed to one of the drilling sites to be temporarily held at port in @entity193			1
a group of opponents , primarily the @entity196 and environmentalists , called for a review of the federal air permits that were issued to @entity30 as part of its drilling plan			1
opponents also fear that floating ice will make any spill in the region a potential disaster			2
" nobody knows how to contain or clean up a spill in the harsh and remote seas of the @entity5 , " said @entity208 , @entity209 president , in a written statement			2
if a " blowout occurs late in the drilling season , there wo n't be time to stop it before the winter ice chokes the site , leaving oil to gush uncontrolled for months			1
" scientists predict there will be less ice by mid-century			0
if @entity30 finds the oil it 's looking for , scientists say melting ice in the @entity229 will make conditions friendlier to floating drilling rigs			1
some predictions say year - round shipping will be common in the region by 2050			0
practical and personal considerations influenced @entity3 's decision , he says			0
growing up , he had no electricity , no running water			0
" you 'd get back and forth from where you need to with dog teams			0
" " i started dealing with looking at my grandkids and my kids and what i had gone through ... and i wanted them to have what i have , if not better			0
" if production dips from the region 's @entity83 wells and pipeline , " our tax revenues go way , way , way down , " @entity3 admits			2
in an era when reliance on foreign oil is seen as a security threat , president @entity257 's support of offshore drilling also helped @entity3 decide			1
" i think it 's inevitable that action is going to happen out here -- in the name of national security if for nothing else			0
" under the agreement negotiated by @entity3 , the borough agreed not to sue @entity30 if the company maintains constant scientific research and halts drilling when whales are in the region			1
they 've agreed to fund a scientific environmental monitoring program with local coastal communities getting from $ 3 million to $ 5 million a year , @entity3 said			2
despite the agreement , @entity3 still says he opposes offshore drilling " mainly because i do n't think enough mitigation measures have been even thought of or done to safeguard our waters and our way of life			1
" the tipping point in reaching the agreement , @entity3 said , was something his father once told him			0
" you 're going to be on a fool 's errand if you think you are going to please everybody , " he said			0
" give it your best shot , seek advice and once you think you 've found that -- go with it and do n't look back			0
" " so that 's the point where i said , ' ok , it 's a compromise			0
' that 's the right way : they have to give			0
" final word on whether to allow exploratory drilling is now up to the @entity299			1
" i think i can rest easy that i have done the very best i could to bring our issues as @entity20 to the forefront , in a way the oil industry understands -- the permitting agencies understand , " @entity3 said			2
" we helped to further set world - class standards for an operation here -- in our garden			0
" how do you feel about drilling ? let us know in the comments below			2
