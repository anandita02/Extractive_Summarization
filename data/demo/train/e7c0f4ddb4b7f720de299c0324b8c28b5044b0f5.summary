-- summer is a time when people ritualistically hit the gym to trim down for swimsuit season , working out to look good in a bathing suit			1
but this time three years ago , all @entity7 wanted was to be able to move again			2
he was struck with @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , a disorder in which the body 's immune system mistakenly attacks the nervous system			2
he spent months lying in a hospital bed , watching his muscles deteriorate			2
finally , his health started to improve enough for him to go into rehabilitation			1
in rehab , he started running			1
it was his way of building back the muscle he 'd lost			2
but after he was discharged , he needed something to keep him moving			2
that 's when he turned to @entity23 , a fitness application that tracks , maps and records the progress of its users ' running activity			1
" i could n't see myself just running on my own without some motivation tool , " the 37 - year - old said			1
@entity7 is one of many people using fitness apps and sites to get in shape			1
more than 10 million people use @entity23 , according to the company			1
it 's just one example of the exponential growth of fitness apps available online and via mobile devices			1
from social media networks to videogame - like interfaces to health resources , technologies like @entity23 are transforming the way @entity46 and others approach fitness			1
work out with your social network you can be an athlete at any age			1
that 's what @entity55 @entity54 said she learned from using a fitness app. two months ago , a close friend introduced her to the app @entity58			1
it was then that she decided to be more than just active			2
" i am 42 years old , i have kids and i work in retail , so i am on my feet all day			1
but in my 40s i told myself i was going to be fit , " she said			2
" this is the new me			2
" although always on the go , this busy mom logs her daily workouts consistently			0
" it works as a way to reach my fitness goals , but it also is helping me on a deeper level , " she said			1
@entity54 finds herself making more health - conscious decisions since starting @entity58			1
" last night my husband was like , ' you do n't look so good , ' and i was like , ' yeah , i am frustrated , i am going out for a run ' at 8 in the evening			0
it was either wine or running , and i choose to go for a run , " she said			1
" it 's a life change			0
" it also keeps her diligent about her workouts			0
" it is motivational and it offers me support			0
it 's the social aspect that helps , " she said			1
@entity58 has more than a half - million users , the fitness app reports			1
although that number is nowhere near those of other social networking sites , it 's a dramatic growth for the niche app , which is geared toward bringing together users who share a common interest of increasing fitness and physical activity			1
@entity58 started off with only a few thousand users during its beta testing days in 2011			1
now , it is growing in popularity with fitness enthusiasts who use the @entity104			1
the fitness app functions as a social networking site with a videogame - style interface that lets users " level up " based on their physical activities			1
for @entity54 , @entity58 's social network makes the app an invaluable resource			1
" it is literally a social network for working out , like @entity116 for fitness , " she said			1
" it is very motivational because it allows me to work out with my social network			1
" the application gives her the opportunity to build relationships with others trying to meet their fitness goals			1
" i have friends on @entity58 that i have never even met , " she said			0
" people keep track of each other and it is very encouraging			1
" be fit at any age middle age met the digital age for fitness enthusiast @entity134			1
the 51 - year - old @entity137 resident was introduced to @entity58 and calorie count by her son			1
at the time , she was on weight loss program @entity140 , and playing tennis occasionally , but she wanted to make sure she stayed on track			0
" i knew i was going to lose the weight , " she said			0
" but i did n't want to gain it back			0
" by combining @entity58 and @entity138 , @entity134 found resources that filled the gaps in her diet and exercise plan			1
calorie count allows her to record and monitor what she is eating , while @entity58 works as a fitness motivator			1
" it is a little extra push , " she said			0
" it is this weird dynamic that gets into your head			0
you are sitting on the couch , watching tv and you think , ' i better get off the couch and get some points			0
' " @entity134 says the apps she uses help her physically and mentally			1
" in a funny way , it kind of enriched my life			0
it gave me tools to help me			0
it happened to come along and it really raised my self - esteem			2
" although she is a relatively active person , @entity134 says it is easy for people her age to become complacent when it comes to fitness			1
" i wish people my age would look to tools like this and think , you do n't have to accept your body is declining , " she said			2
" technology does n't have to make you lazier ; it can do the opposite			0
" get motivated to ' just do it ' one year ago , @entity183 tipped the scale at 230 pounds			0
it was a combination of a poor diet and eating out every day that lead him down his weight - gaining path			2
but one day @entity183 said to himself , " just do it , " and he strapped on a pair of sneakers and ran , jogged and walked a little over five miles			0
" i think what got me going was anger and willpower			0
i was angry at myself , and i was motivated , " he said			0
he started using @entity196 + as a way to monitor his physical activities			0
@entity196 + is a fitness app that allows its users to track their physical activities , which it then displays using visually rich graphs			1
the app also lets users share their fitness progress with other users			1
monitoring progress is a big part of why the @entity211 resident uses @entity196 + consistently			0
" the @entity196 + app was the greatest thing that happened because it kept me going , " @entity183 said			0
" when you look at the app and you can see your progress and see that i started off at zero and i ran 700 miles , it is incredible			0
" but the app did n't instantly turn @entity183 's life around			0
" when i first started running , i told myself and other people that if i am running i can keep eating , but that is n't how it works , " he said			1
a year of complete diet change -- worked out through trial and error -- and increased fitness helped him drop the weight			2
" it may sound @entity231 © , but i want to live a healthier lifestyle and inspire others , " he said with regard to why he decided to lose weight			0
" i inspired a few friends to go with me on my runs and they are also living a healthier lifestyle			0
at the same time , i 'm unemployed and it 's the best way to improve myself , " he said			0
work on a better life the day @entity240 and his wife had their daughter @entity242 , his life changed			2
his family was changing , and he wanted to change , too			0
he was living a sedentary life , spending many hours on the couch watching television or surfing the @entity248			0
his lifestyle led to overeating and it started to show around his waist			0
curious about calculating body fat and increasing fitness , the @entity253 , @entity254 , resident discovered @entity258 , a website aimed at tracking its users ' weight training and fitness progress while also offering video and fitness tutorials			1
" i had never considered using ( a fitness site ) before , but when i started doing the data entry to get my body fat percentage , i became really curious about the other aspects of the site , and that was what got me started , " he said			2
easy data entry makes the site convenient for him , and it encourages him to set more personal fitness goals			2
his overall goal is to gain more energy for his family 's sake			0
" i think a large part of who we are is developed when we 're young , " said @entity240			0
" i think that if my wife and i do a good job of presenting ourselves as positive role models in all facets of life , as my daughter goes through her childhood , being fit will become a part of her life as well			0
" it 's not only about you @entity46 admits he was never a runner			0
he 's more concerned with keeping up his endurance after @entity9 than becoming an athlete			0
and years after his hospitalization , @entity46 says his fitness is not only about him anymore			2
" it was not about returning to just a level of fitness			2
we just had a baby and i wanted to quickly get back to shape so that i can actively engage with her as she grows up , " he said			0
even after three years , @entity7 still uses @entity23 because he knows how fast life can change			1
" experiencing @entity9 , you find out how quickly health can disappear , " he said			2
" you should try to keep up with your levels , because you do n't know when you wo n't be able to do the things you want to do			0
" when he talks about using @entity23 , he ca n't help but be reminded of his time spent in rehabilitation			1
" during rehab they group you with people with spinal cord injuries , and you think , ' i will get better , ' because that is how @entity9 works , but they will not get better			2
they are just trying to get to a level where they can cope ( with ) what happened to them , " he said			0
" when you see something like that , you want to get healthier			0
