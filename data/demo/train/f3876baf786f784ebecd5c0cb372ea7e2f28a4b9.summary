@entity9 's husband @entity23 clearly remembers the day in may 2012 when his wife and two children were summoned to a meeting with immigration officials to be told that the country 's security intelligence organization , @entity28 , had given @entity9 a " negative assessment			1
" " we do n't comment on any individual cases , but it means that an assessment by our security intelligence organization has identified that person may be of risk , and we need to take seriously that it 's our job to make sure that the community is safe , " @entity2 attorney - general @entity31 said recently when asked about the case			1

@entity0 is unable to verify details of @entity9 's story with the @entity2 @entity64 ( @entity64 ) because it will not comment on individual cases			1
" it 's a very difficult situation -- i understand why people are agitated about it -- but it is important for people to remember that we do have an obligation as a government to keep the country as safe as we can			0
where these fairly rare security assessments are made , it 's very difficult for us to do anything other than to act upon them , " @entity31 said			0
@entity9 's supporters say they suspect her detention has something to do with her former husband , a @entity83 who was killed during fighting in @entity14 , though that is also unable to be confirmed			1
@entity9 's story @entity23 tells @entity0 that in 2008 @entity9 was living as a widow with two young children in @entity14 as the country lurched toward the brutal end of a civil war between the government and the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) her first husband had been killed in 2006 , leaving his young family at the mercy of fighting in the @entity97 area , where the @entity98 alleges both sides murdered civilians , according to a report released in march 2011			1
@entity9 first sought refuge in @entity103 before boarding a boat that she was told could take them to a new life in @entity2			1
their vessel arrived in @entity2 waters in april 2010 , long after it had run out of food and fuel			2
@entity23 says @entity9 told him the @entity2 @entity112 brought his wife and children ashore and took them for processing by immigration authorities on @entity118			1
three more moves followed , to detention centers in @entity121 , @entity122 and then @entity123 where they were released to community detention in april 2011			2
five months later , they were granted refugee status			1
there was just one more security check to go through before they were granted permanent visas			2
@entity23 's story @entity23 says he met @entity9 at a friend 's house in @entity123 during the @entity135 of 2011			1
her two young boys were polite and well - behaaved and @entity9 seemed to like him			1
@entity23 was three years older and from the same region of @entity14 before he left in 2004 to study information technology in @entity2 on a student visa			1

it was not safe to return			0
he applied for a protection visa and was later granted permanent @entity2 residency			1
he says he will soon qualify for @entity2 citizenship			2
in april of 2012 , life was good			0
he was working as an it consultant , had just married @entity9 , and she and her sons had moved in with him in @entity53			2
they started calling him " dad , " or " appa " in @entity83			0
the law @entity9 is not the only refugee who is being indefinitely detained in @entity2			1
there are 56 whose cases are being reviewed by the country 's first independent reviewer , retired @entity162 judge @entity160			0
@entity163 was appointed in october 2012 , six months after an @entity2 @entity165 report into the country 's @entity166 concurred with the government 's stated view that cases of indefinite detention should be subject to review			1
the committee 's final report , released in april 2012 , said that it " resolutely rejects the indefinite detention of people without any right of appeal			0
such detention , effectively condemning refugees who have not been charged with any crime to detention for the term of their natural life , runs counter to the basic principles of justice underpinning @entity2 society			1
" because she has already been found to be legitimate refugee , @entity9 ca n't be deported			1
and her high risk status prevents her from being released			0
" it 's still the government 's strong view that non-australian citizens who have been given an adverse security assessment should not be permanently settled in @entity2			1
we ensure appropriate arrangements are in place for the care and support of people detained due to an adverse security assessment , " a @entity64 spokesman told @entity0			2
@entity28 has not revealed the criteria it uses to decide if someone is a security risk			1
the organization 's director - general @entity206 told the @entity165 that " once the criteria for making assessments are known , then you will find very quickly that all the applicants will have methods of evading or avoiding demonstrating those characteristics			0
" he said the decision to issue an adverse assessment " was not taken lightly			0
" " nor are we contemptuous of or @entity216 © about the human rights of the individual 's involved			0
" we take very seriously our responsibility to behave ethically and professionally and , obviously , with the utmost probity , " he added			0
still , the process undertaken by @entity163 has offered a glimmer of hope to those in indefinite detention that their status could change			2
letters dated december 4 , 2012 were sent to all 56 detainees who are considered a national risk			0
so far , 54 have requested their cases be reviewed , according to @entity163 's office			0
during the review process , detainees will be allowed to see an @entity28 summary explaining why they are considered a risk to @entity2			1
however , according to the terms of reference , information will only be included " to the extent able without prejudicing the interests of security			0
" @entity163 's office has confirmed to @entity0 that @entity9 's case has been given priority , along with a number of others			2
life in detention @entity9 and her sons are being held in a " lower security " section of @entity19 in @entity20 with other families who are waiting for their claims to be processed			1
the boys are not free to leave			0
@entity23 says that they were given refugee status but had not been granted permanent visas when their mother failed the security test			1
he says he 's trying to secure them a visa but until then they must stay in detention			0
very soon they 'll be joined by @entity8			0
because his father has permanent residency , @entity8 qualifies as an @entity2 citizen and will be allowed to leave the center , just not with his mother			1
" the situation is deplorable , " said @entity9 's lawyer , @entity269 , executive director of the @entity270			2
he called on the government " as a matter of basic decency , humanity and common sense " to use its powers of discretion to release @entity9 and her children " so they can reunite and live in freedom with their husband and father as a family			2
" more than a dozen children now live in @entity19 , according to @entity286 , an advocacy group that campaigns against the detention of minors			0
a @entity64 spokesman declined to confirm how many , but said the children have access to play areas and are taken on regular excursions outside the center , swimming and to the park			0
every day , the older children are escorted to and from school by officials from @entity301 , the company contracted to run @entity2 detention centers			1
their parents are also allowed to accompany them , the @entity64 spokesman said			0
@entity286 's campaign director @entity306 says that despite efforts to support the children they are clearly traumatized by their surroundings			0
" they feel that they 're bad people and that they 're being punished which means they have very low self esteem , " she said			0
" they have nightmares , suffer from anxiety and are quite stressed and i do n't think you should find a five year old having anxiety attacks , wetting the bed and waking up in the middle of the night distressed			0
" in its final report , the @entity165 said it " received no evidence to contradict the view that detention was an unhealthy and damaging environment for children			0
" and this is where @entity23 knows their baby will be unless his wife is freed			0
the campaign since @entity9 's story emerged in the @entity2 press , campaigners have lobbied for her release			1
people who have met her in @entity2 describe her as a " very shy " and " very sweet " woman , who is now confused and anxious			2
hundreds of people have emailed their support to " @entity342 , " a website that urges the @entity2 government to reassess her case			2
on @entity9 's due date , january 6 , pregnant mothers with children showed up at closed prisons in @entity2 and held up signs reading " born free			1
" @entity23 says he 's excited by the birth of his first born , but fearful for his son 's future			0
he says he has no reason to doubt his wife 's story and does not accept that she is a threat to national security			0
he just wants his family home .			0

widowed by fighting , @entity9 fled @entity14 with her two young boys in 2008
they took a boat to @entity2 where they were granted refugee status in 2011
however , the 33 - year - old failed an @entity28 security test and was detained in @entity20
she gave birth to a baby boy tuesday , he will join his mother and *brothers* in detention
