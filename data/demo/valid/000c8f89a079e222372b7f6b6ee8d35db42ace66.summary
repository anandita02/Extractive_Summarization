" this is going to be a test for @entity2			1
we 're going to find out what she 's made of			2
how mentally tough she really is			2
" those were the words of tennis analyst @entity9 in 2001 , early into @entity2 ' decider with @entity11 in the final of one of tennis ' most prestigious tournaments			1
the match was being televised on one of the biggest sports networks in the world , @entity20			2
the then 17 - year - old @entity11 had just held to love amid vociferous cheers and -- in a breach of tennis etiquette -- a large portion of the fans on center court at the event now known as the @entity28 roared approvingly when @entity2 struck a double fault to begin the next game			1
despite @entity2 growing up about 130 miles away in a suburb of @entity33 , while @entity11 hailed from @entity34 , there was clearly no home - court advantage			1
@entity2 ' father , @entity37 , and older sister , @entity38 , were booed as they made their way to their seats prior to the finale , with @entity37 claiming in @entity43 he was the victim of racial abuse			1
@entity45 , meanwhile , said in a press conference at her next tournament she " heard whatever he heard			1
" it was @entity51 who shaped his daughters into grand slam winners from a humble background , bereft of the type of money used to help manufacture many a champion			2
" one guy said , ' i wish it was ' 75 , we 'd skin you alive , ' " @entity51 told @entity43			2
" i had trouble holding back tears			2
i think @entity28 disgraced @entity65			1
" @entity66 , then the tournament director , said in the same story that he did n't discount @entity51 was racially abused			1
@entity3 did not hear back from @entity66 when it put in an interview request for him and @entity11 declined an interview request			2
the fans ' reaction apparently stemmed from the sisters ' semifinal -- or lack of it			0
@entity45 pulled out a mere minutes prior to the start , citing a knee injury			1
whispers of @entity51 pre-determining the outcome grew , no doubt aided by the comments of @entity82			0
after @entity45 beat @entity82 in the quarterfinals , the @entity83 said the sisters ' father would " decide " who won			1
@entity2 , who was 19 back then , ultimately passed the ' test ' that day against @entity11 , judging by the result : a three - set win			1
@entity2 has certainly , too , shown her mental toughness over the years , adding 18 grand slam singles titles to the one she won prior to 2001			1
but what transpired tarnished the tournament , the sport and hurt one of tennis ' all - time greats to such an extent that she stayed away from @entity28			1
@entity2 plays her first match in @entity28 in 14 years on friday , saying she was " following her heart " in deciding to return			1
in the years that have passed since 2001 , @entity2 went from teen to young adult to veteran , all the while collecting major titles elsewhere			1
" it has been difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the @entity28 @entity113 locker room after winning in 2001 , driving back to @entity33 feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , " @entity2 told @entity115 in february			1
" emotionally it seemed easier to stay away			0
" there are some who say i should never go back			0
there are others who say i should 've returned years ago			2
i understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time			0
" i 'm just following my heart on this one			0
" @entity128 , a former owner of the tournament and now its chief executive , was " elated " to have @entity2 back in the field			1
" in the past , the things that happened , there were no winners , " @entity128 told @entity3			0
" i think it was a terrible incident			0
now , @entity2 has been able to change that			1
we 're grateful , excited and happy and we 're going to welcome her with open arms			0
" in terms of her reception , i would like her to be here feeling that her decision was received with the greatest and warmest reception possible			0
" but @entity2 will be the lone @entity149 winner in her family attending			1
@entity2 speaks about nerves before 1st match back at @entity28 even with the best efforts of the tournament -- now owned by billionaire @entity155 -- @entity45 is continuing her boycott , as is @entity51 , according to @entity128			1
the siblings ' mom , @entity157 , will be alongside @entity2 , though , added @entity128			1
@entity2 told reporters in @entity28 on thursday that her father , mother and @entity45 gave her their blessing when she contemplated coming back to @entity28			1
" we wanted to get @entity38 , " said @entity128			0
" in fact we 'd like to welcome the whole family			0
but @entity38 i think is not quite in the same place as @entity2 is			2
and so we 've not been successful in enticing her to enter or take a wild card			0
" but @entity169 is coming and so are some other family members			0
" @entity2 scoffed at suggestions that the sisters ' match in @entity28 -- or any other between them -- was fixed			1
" throughout my whole career , integrity has been everything to me , " she told @entity115			0
" it is also everything and more to @entity38			0
the false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt , cut and ripped into us deeply			0
" the under - current of racism was painful , confusing and unfair			0
in a game i loved with all my heart , at one of my most cherished tournaments , i suddenly felt unwelcome , alone and afraid			0
" reflecting on the incident , @entity190 , the chief executive of the women 's tour in 2001 , said @entity45 had been suffering from a genuine injury and that the notion that @entity51 dictated the outcome of matches between his daughters was off the mark			1
but he admitted things could have been handled better			0
@entity45 , for example , might have explained her withdrawal to fans on court and then signed autographs , he said , citing the example of last year 's @entity207			2
@entity208 withdrew from the final in @entity210 -- but not before he addressed fans and signed autographs			0
what happened in the final between @entity2 and @entity11 was awful , said @entity215			2
" i thought it was horrible , " he told @entity3			0
" i thought it was very tough on the players			0
" by that time i 'd known enough to know that @entity38 had been significantly injured and that it was not a set - up of any kind			0
i thought it was unfair to @entity2 and @entity11			2
" @entity2 is twice a champion at the tournament and winning this year would be " fantastic , " said @entity128			1
but even if not , he added : " i think it 's a wonderful ending in closing an ugly chapter			0
we 're just looking forward , we 're not looking backward			0

@entity2 makes her return to @entity28 on friday
she has n't played at the tournament since 2001
her dad said he was racially abused at the tournament in 2001
@entity45 still has not returned to the @entity237 event
