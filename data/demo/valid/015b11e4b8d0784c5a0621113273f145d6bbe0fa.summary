@entity0 held a closed door meeting with president @entity3 at the @entity4 on monday			1
although the former secretary of state , senator and first lady has not declared , it is treated as a foregone conclusion that @entity10 is running for president			1
likely to launch her campaign in april , @entity10 is regarded as the front - runner — if not the only @entity16 candidate — and the inevitable @entity16 nominee			2
there is an assumption that since @entity10 supported @entity3 , the black community will now embrace her			1
but there are more than a few who did n't get that memo			0
at this stage of the game , many african - americans may not be excited about a candidate @entity0 in 2016			1
and after two terms of the nation 's first black president , she should proceed with caution			0
@entity10 need look no further than the 2008 contest , when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects			1
early on , @entity10 was the favorite of black folks , lest you forgot , and it did not hurt that president @entity10 had been regarded as the " first black president " with high approval among african - americans			2
then , support for a senator named @entity3 blew up after the @entity47 caucuses			1
and @entity10 found herself apologizing for her husband 's comments about @entity3 's win in the @entity53 primary			1
president @entity10 was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared @entity3 's win in the @entity58 state to that of @entity60 in 2004 and 2008 , suggesting that @entity3 , like @entity60 , would not win			1
the misstep was an affront to many african - americans , as were @entity0 's suggestions on the campaign trail that @entity3 was only good for making speeches , but not for taking action			1
and let 's not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for " hard - working @entity63 , white @entity63			1
" we can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited campaign - trail junk - talking , and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election			2
president @entity3 made @entity10 his secretary of state , and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the @entity3 @entity79			1
but that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter , racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago			2
black voters are among the most loyal of the @entity16 base , and their record high turnout for @entity3 was an important part of his victory			1
however , with a charismatic @entity3 no longer on the ballot , maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge			2
@entity91 : blacks are treated 72 % as well as whites moreover , as for @entity10 , who ( understandably ? ) has her own ideas and may not agree with the president on certain issues , any criticism of @entity3 could cost her some black voters			1
remember that @entity10 voted in favor of the unpopular , costly and deadly @entity103 war			0
that support cost @entity10 in 2008			2
and while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of @entity108 prime minister @entity107 , @entity10 's strongly pro-israel stance on @entity111 peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the @entity16 base , including blacks , latinos and young voters			0
however , it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to @entity0 as economics			0
because she is tied to the @entity126 wing of her party and commands sky - high speaking fees , people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class , and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy			0
the nation is hurting , despite the economic turnaround , and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks , who still have high unemployment rates , a rising wealth gap compared to whites , and , for many , no recovery in sight			0
and while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community , @entity10 has remained relatively quiet on the subject			0
she will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement			0
this , rather than her email account , is what concerns the black electorate			0
@entity91 : let 's stop the ' struggle equation ' perhaps a populist , more down - to - earth challenger such as @entity162 sen. @entity161 or former @entity164 sen. @entity163 could appeal to black and working - class voters , and unlike @entity10 , would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble , or lacking core beliefs other than being in power			2
it is safe to assume that if @entity10 wins the @entity16 nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election , but that may not be enough			0
let 's remember president @entity178 won re-election in 2004 with just 11 % of the black vote			0
had @entity181 been able to duplicate that number of black votes , he would be president now			0
@entity3 won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012 , particularly in swing states like @entity188			1
@entity10 ca n't assume she 'll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm			0
support for @entity3 does not necessarily translate into support for another @entity194			2
this means @entity10 must fight for votes like anyone else : knock on doors , kiss babies , clap off beat at the @entity202 church , and do whatever it takes .			0

@entity206 : the former secretary of state would need to *woo* @entity209 - @entity63 voters to turn out in big numbers for 2016
