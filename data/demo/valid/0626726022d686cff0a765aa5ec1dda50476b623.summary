the family of @entity1 may have reason to be hopeful again			1
in may 2013 , when police discovered three young women who had been imprisoned inside a nondescript @entity9 home for nearly a decade , @entity1 ' family and law enforcement hoped one of the women would be @entity1 , who disappeared in @entity9 around the same time as the other women			1
but the discovery turned out to be unrelated to @entity1 's case and there was no new information about her whereabouts			1
but nearly eight years since she was last seen or heard from , the family 's optimism has been restored by an unlikely discovery her step - grandmother made on the @entity22 most wanted website in january			1
an @entity28 surveillance photo -- released by the @entity29 , @entity22 , @entity30 in late october -- depicts an unidentified woman with a familiar face , special agent @entity24 of the @entity26 @entity25 said			1
" this is an incredible lookalike , " @entity33 said of the photo			0
the resemblance to @entity1 , who would now be 21 , is " strikingly similar , " she added			2
the woman in the photo , along with an unidentified man she appears with , was being sought by @entity22 police as a suspect in a string of check and identification thefts in @entity22 and @entity45 , the @entity26 said			1
@entity1 's step - grandmother alerted the @entity26 about the photo , @entity33 said			1
" there 's nothing that tells us that it is her , but there 's nothing telling us that it 's not her either , " @entity33 said			0
still , she considers the surveillance footage to be a breakthrough in the case , given that the @entity26 has found no legitimate sightings or social media activity by @entity1 since she disappeared on july 6 , 2007			1
" it 's the best lead we have , " @entity33 said			0
" we 've had other supposed lookalikes , but nothing that has looked this similar			0
we consider this a huge tip for us			0
" because it is not possible to see the license plate of the car the couple was driving , @entity33 said the @entity26 will rely exclusively on help from the public			2
" the @entity26 is utilizing a billboard campaign , social media and any news outlet that will air these photos for us , " @entity33 said			0
in the 2013 case , two of the missing women had been identified and police said they had disappeared within four years of when @entity1 went missing -- and within five blocks of where she was last seen			2
" at first , when they said the third girl was n't identified , i was hoping one would be @entity1 , " @entity85 , her aunt , told @entity2 at the time			0
but the family 's nightmare continued			0
" there is no new information that 's come to light about her : @entity1 is an active , open investigation , " @entity94 deputy chief @entity93 said at the time			2
" i can assure you that her disappearance was part of our questioning of the three subjects that we brought in			0

@entity1 disappeared on july 6 , 2007 , when she was *14*
her step - grandmother saw a photo of a woman who looks like @entity1 on the @entity110 website
the @entity26 is seeking the public 's assistance in identifying the woman
