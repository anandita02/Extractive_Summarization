@entity0 has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes			1
the low - cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $ 69 round - trip fares in april and may that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply			1
round - trip purchase is not required , so you could actually pay $ 34.50 for a one - way flight			2
but the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy , which obliquely references a sexual act			1
" we 've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years , " reads the offer on @entity0 's website			1
" it 's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother 's bed ( the one with the fantastic articles )			0
use your mouth to spread the word : spirit is in an even better position to get you where you 're going			0
" some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste			0
" you ca n't object to that price point , but you certainly can object to the discount airline 's marketing strategy , which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if @entity0 's website was hacked , " wrote @entity36 of @entity37 in @entity38			1
spirit spokesman @entity45 , in a prepared statement , said the promotion reflects the airline 's quirky culture			2
" @entity0 is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be			1
we enjoy being different than other airlines , " said @entity45 , @entity0 's director of corporate communications			2
" when it comes to advertising , different means we do n't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares			0
but we 're also different because our ads are fun , provocative , sometimes silly and often irreverent			0
they get lots of attention , " he added			0
" the vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are			0
we understand there is a small group of people who feel differently			0
" the $ 69 fares must be booked by the end of the day tuesday			1
questionable taste or not , the promotion may be working : people were complaining on @entity78 that they could n't access @entity0 's website to book flights			2
based in @entity81 , @entity0 is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can			1
the airline 's defense is simple : pay for what you want on your flight , and do n't pay for what you do n't want			0
airline plans $ 15 flights to @entity93			2

@entity0 is offering *suggestive* $ 69 fares
the airline announced them with a pitch that may *remind* us of high *school* jokes
the cheeky airline is known for charging for almost all *extras*
