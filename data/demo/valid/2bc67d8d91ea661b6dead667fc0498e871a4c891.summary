once again the global community waits to see if the @entity2 and its partners can really halt @entity5 's quest for nuclear power through a verifiable accord or if @entity8 is trying to buy more time for a clandestine nuclear weapons program it is suspected of having			1
true , the government of the @entity5 has consistently denied it seeks anything more than nuclear energy for peaceful purposes			1
but supreme leader ayatollah @entity16 's repeated claims in public forums that " we do not have nuclear weapons , and we do not intend to produce them , " have failed to convince the @entity2 , @entity18 and @entity19			2
suspicion is well - warranted			0
@entity5 reluctantly disclosed to the @entity23 , or @entity23 — only after @entity2 - led detection — its clandestine enrichment of uranium at an underground facility near @entity28 , testing of bridge wires to explode the detonators of atom bombs at the @entity34 military facility near @entity8 , and development of an advanced multipoint trigger system for nuclear warheads			1
even the @entity23 director noted on march 2 that the agency still could not " provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in @entity5 and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in @entity5 is in peaceful activities			2
" as a result , the chief ayatollah 's words seem more intended for defusing the international storm rather than changing domestic policy			0
moreover , @entity16 has made it amply clear to @entity5 's citizens in the text of an infographic on his website , also reproduced by the state - controlled news media , that " @entity5 must not cease or slow down " but should " continue nuclear research , expansion , and progress			1
" he has threatened as well , repeatedly , that @entity5 will unleash a " crushing response " against any nation with which it clashes , making his stated intent to continue nuclear activities more ominous			2
however , economically strapped and internationally isolated , @entity5 's citizens are putting pronounced pressure on president @entity69 and @entity16			1
a november 2014 @entity70 indicates 70 % of @entity5 hope their leaders will accept an agreement			2
they expect the country 's economy will jump - start through reduction or elimination of sanctions			0
so @entity5 politicians and clerics , even those on the @entity81 and @entity82 , have gradually begun acknowledging that sooner or later " some sort of a result [ i.e. , nuclear deal ] " will have to be accepted by @entity8			1
ordinary @entity5 ' desire to reach a pact with the @entity88 is understandable			0
@entity5 's economy ranks only 32nd in the world , according to data from the @entity92 , despite its vast energy resources and well - educated public			1
consequently its people 's prosperity has fallen to a lowly 107th among the world 's societies , according to the @entity99			0
plunging oil prices have recently added to domestic woes , with that country facing deeper deficit in revenues much needed for development projects			0
@entity5 leaders realize their regime remains vulnerable not only to externally imposed sanctions , but more so to internally generated widespread discontent , which erupted and was violently repressed in 2009			2
regime preservation has multiple facets , however			0
it 's not just about keeping citizens fiscally happy			0
nuclear weapons work well in deterring external adversaries			0
processing such technology generates much pride at home , too			0
fifty - six percent of @entity5 responded favorably to its continued development when polled in january			0
consequently there will be countervailing internal pressure on @entity5 's leaders to withstand fully meeting obligations under the @entity125 , irrespective of whether a deal is reached , even if the socioeconomic cost to their citizens and fever - pitch global consternation continue to rise			1
but @entity5 's leaders also know full well that agreeing to a pact that lifts most or all sanctions will boost the economy and thereby generate additional resources to enhance the regime 's popularity at home and influence abroad			1
this central goal of @entity5 's presence at the negotiating table was made crystal clear during the @entity147 's @entity146 , or @entity148 , public address on march 21 : " removal of sanctions is part of the subject of negotiations , not of the results ... removal of sanctions should occur without any deal when an agreement is reached			1
" " we can see a path forward here to get to an agreement ... [ and ] very much believe we can get this done by [ the deadline of ] march 31 , " stressed a senior @entity157 official traveling with @entity2 secretary of state @entity158 to @entity159 on march 25			0
negotiators have even added three more months to resolve the technical details of the overall agreement			0
diplomacy may , as the @entity170 administration has stressed repeatedly , indeed be the most efficient and least dangerous way to prevent @entity5 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			2
certainly neither the @entity2 nor the @entity175 publics want another drawn - out war in the @entity177			0
but as the @entity2 and other world powers work fervently toward clinching the long - awaited nuclear agreement with the @entity182 republic , it is important for @entity184 negotiators and politicians to bear two central considerations in mind : ( 1 ) irrespective of mechanisms written into the deal , will verification actually be possible on the ground to ensure @entity5 both limits and becomes fully transparent about its nuclear program ? ( 2 ) would the world collectively or the @entity2 independently be able to enforce punitive actions , such as re-establishing sanctions , if @entity5 fails to comply fully and in a timely manner ? @entity5 's president continues to suggest that his country seeks a " win - win deal which would serve the interests of all the parties , " as does his negotiating team			1
but many @entity184 and @entity177 leaders fear the @entity2 and its allies will not be able to truly enforce nuclear limits upon @entity5 through any treaty			1
certainly not only many @entity209 and @entity210 nations , but even two of the superpowers , @entity213 and @entity214 , see little if any threat from @entity8 and would much prefer to reopen large - scale trade with @entity5 than argue about atomic fission			0
last november , @entity213 even entered into an agreement to build at least two nuclear reactors in @entity5			2
once sanctions are lifted , multinational corporations will likely invest heavily in @entity5 and resist having to pull out subsequently			0
not surprisingly , influential hard - line @entity5 leaders including ayatollah @entity225 , who heads @entity5 's judiciary , trumpet : " our country and our negotiating officials ... are the real winners in these talks			1
" four years ago @entity5 's @entity230 declared : " the day after @entity5 's first nuclear test is a normal day ... but for some of us there will be a new sparkle in our eyes			1
" even if a deal is done , will @entity5 gamble that with the exception of the @entity2 and @entity19 , nations can come to live with it eventually reaching the threshold of nuclear breakout or wielding nuclear weapons ?			1

they say @entity5 's leaders recognize that having a nuclear program can elevate its international clout
