a @entity3 helicopter that went down in waters off the @entity5 three days ago -- killing 11 service members -- had aborted a training mission due to bad weather before it crashed , a military official said friday			1
on the same day that officials released the names of the seven @entity12 who were aboard , new details emerged friday on the fatal mission at the @entity15 near @entity16			1
as officials continue to investigate why the aircraft went down in thick fog tuesday , maj. gen. @entity20 -- commander of @entity21 ( @entity21 ) -- told reporters that the @entity3 was one of two that had to abort exercises involving water " insertion and extraction techniques " before the crash			1
" my understanding is ... that they were flying as we normally do -- two aircraft together , " @entity20 said			0
" as they went in , they encountered bad weather and made the decision to wave off and to abort the training mission			0
at that point , the one helicopter obviously made it back and determined that the second helicopter was not back with them in that return			1
" the crash occurred at night -- hours after the two helicopters had successfully completed the same training exercise in daylight			1
the @entity3 helicopters were training near @entity16 as heavy fog shrouded the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern @entity5 and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. tuesday , the military said			1
" the fog was moving in and out , " @entity20 said			0
" i think they had done the pre-assessment before going in , said that everything appeared to be ok , but then -- even in route -- made the decision ( that ) the risk was too high			0
" the second helicopter lost communication with the missing aircraft and returned to begin the search operation , @entity20 said			2
that operation has transitioned from rescue to recovery , with the military focused on recovering the helicopter , military officials said			2
searchers found the helicopter at the bottom of the sound , and the bodies of the seven @entity12 and four @entity77 members who were aboard			1
the bodies of at least two @entity80 members were recovered thursday , and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface , the @entity77 said			1
the crew members were with 1 - 244th @entity85 from @entity86 , @entity87 , according to a statement from the @entity89			2
@entity20 said the remains will be taken to @entity91 in @entity92 for identification and forensic examinations before being turned over to the soldiers ' families for burial			0
on friday , @entity21 , based at @entity98 , @entity99 , identified the seven @entity12 who perished in the crash as capt. @entity102 , 31 , of @entity103 , @entity104 ; master sgt. @entity105 , 33 , of @entity106 , @entity107 ; staff sgt. @entity108 , 26 , of @entity109 , @entity110 ; staff sgt. @entity111 , 29 , of @entity112 , @entity110 ; staff sgt. @entity113 , 33 , of @entity114 , @entity115 ; staff sgt. @entity116 , 27 , of @entity117 , @entity118 ; and staff sgt. @entity119 , 26 , of @entity120 , @entity110			1
they gave all : profiles of those killed in helicopter crash the names of the four @entity89 members were not released			1
" to have such a tremendous group of @entity12 -- obviously the experience that they had , the cohesion and teamwork and everything else that they exhibited -- it definitely hit us all hard by having that many at one time , " @entity20 said of the deaths			1
the cause of the crash is under investigation			2
@entity138 , chief of the @entity16 's fire department , said a couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise but that " nobody saw anything because of the dense fog			0
" " people said they heard a loud bang , and that was it , " @entity138 said thursday			0
the second @entity3 -- which , like the first , was assigned to the 1 - 244th @entity85 based in @entity86 , @entity87 -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of @entity154			1
" whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , " @entity156 spokesman @entity155 said earlier this week			2
@entity138 said the fire department , which has a unit on @entity163 near the crash site , was called to help at about 10 p.m. tuesday , roughly 90 minutes after the crash			1
the military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage , he said			0
military officials have said it 's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash			2
the 11 service members , all men , were involved in a seven - day training exercise of amphibious operations , said capt. @entity178 , a spokesman for the @entity179			2
it involved small boats , and inserting and extracting @entity12 from the water via helicopter			1
@entity178 would not say which phase of the training the @entity12 were in tuesday night			1
the initial search was hampered by dense fog , to the point that searchers on boats " could not see , " @entity138 said			0
on wednesday morning , after searchers got a sonar hit , a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound , @entity138 said			0
divers then went into the water " to start retrieving the aircrew , " @entity138 said , without specifying how many bodies were recovered			2
the helicopter had broken into several pieces in a " high - impact crash , " he said			1
the @entity203 has hired a salvage company from @entity205 , @entity206 , to take the wreckage from the water , @entity138 said			0
on wednesday , gen. @entity209 , chairman of the @entity210 , said the crash was " a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat			0
" " we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for			0
" @entity20 said the 2,500 @entity21 troops have been deployed to @entity223 and other conflict zones during the last eight years -- earning seven @entity225 , 19 @entity226 , 207 @entity227 and 189 @entity228			0
" it is a very tight organization , and many of these @entity12 and sailors associated with @entity21 are more senior @entity12 , " @entity20 said			1
" their families are all very close			0
in this particular case , they were all from the same team so they were very , very close			0
and everyone immediately rallied together			0
" @entity1 's @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
