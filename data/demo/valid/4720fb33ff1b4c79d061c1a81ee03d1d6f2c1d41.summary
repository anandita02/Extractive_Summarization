when an officer kills an unarmed suspect , the question arises time and again : can a police department investigate a high - stakes case involving one of its own , without bias ? for @entity11 residents decrying the death of unarmed teen @entity13 , the question is n't even an issue			1
" the investigation is being conducted by the state			2
we have a new law here in @entity11 where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer - involved shootings , " @entity18 mayor @entity17 said			1
in fact , @entity11 is one of only two states with such legislation			1
and that brings some comfort to @entity13 's family			1
" i trust @entity11 and the way they 're handling the investigation , " @entity13 's uncle @entity35 told reporters			1
" we spoke to investigators from @entity40 ( @entity41 )			2
we trust them , and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes			0
we do n't want our biases involved , we do n't want anybody else 's			2
we want them to act strictly as fact - finders , and that 's what we believe in , and we have confidence in that			2
" @entity11 's law , which was enacted just last april , requires " an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators ... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer - involved death			1
" after that , investigators must provide a report to the district attorney			2
if the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved , then the investigators must release their report to the public			1
@entity31 's law requires the state 's @entity76 with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement , according to the @entity80			1
the state 's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor , and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor , the @entity80 said			2
after that , @entity31 's @entity76 must submit a report to the state 's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate			1
while such laws are rather novel , a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for , or providing independent investigation in , officer - involved deaths , according to the @entity80			1
they include @entity101 , @entity31 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111			2
" typically it does n't work when you have to police yourself , " said @entity112 , a @entity1 legal analyst who has began her career as a @entity102 public defender and now practices criminal law for @entity117			0
" this is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up			0
" having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors , " she said			1
" there 's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt			2
many are not , but that is the perception			0
to begin to address that , these laws are needed			0
" she noted the case of @entity142 , a 12 - year - old @entity143 boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in november 2014			2
after they were pressured from the child 's family and the public , the police released surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy			2
@entity112 thinks it 's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general 's office to review police - involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency			1
@entity1 legal analyst and former @entity102 prosecutor @entity162 said there are several reasons why outside entities , such as special prosecutors , are n't tasked with reviewing police shootings			1
" traditionally , elected district attorneys think they 've done a fair and reasonable job with cases , " he said			0
" and frankly they perceive ( appointment of a special prosecutor ) as an insult and an attack on their integrity			0
it implies they are incapable of investigating police			0
" there are " powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation , " @entity162 said			0
it 's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings , he said , and when budgets are already stretched thin , the idea of creating a new bureaucracy is n't appealing			1
@entity162 also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations			0
" for the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large @entity199 cities and getting to the point where they can elect @entity203 or @entity204 district attorneys , " he said			0
" if a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call ( for justice ) ? in the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system			0
" though @entity11 's law has been in place for less than a year , it has already been applied in another officer - related killing			1
@entity223 police officer @entity222 shot @entity224 , a mentally ill man , more than a dozen times last april			2
the officer said he opened fire when @entity224 grabbed his baton and struck him with it			0
@entity222 was not charged in the death , but he was fired for not following protocol			0
@entity13 's death stirred memories of two other unarmed men killed by police : @entity235 , who was shot by officer @entity236 in @entity237 , @entity104 , and @entity238 , who died at the hands of @entity102 police officer @entity240			1
but there are stark differences between @entity13 's case and the two others			1
after @entity235 's death in august , @entity245 police chief @entity245 asked the neighboring @entity248 to investigate			1
the case was not investigated by the state and was referred to a grand jury -- just like in @entity238 's case			1
" the decisions of grand juries not to indict the officers involved in the deaths of @entity238 and @entity235 raised two primary concerns , " the @entity80 said			0
" first , many were worried that since the evidence on which grand juries base their assessment is sealed , there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of their decisions			0
" second , there was apprehension over the decision not to appoint a special prosecutor in either case			0
some are concerned that police may receive favorable treatment due to the close proximity in which law enforcement and district attorneys work			0
" @entity13 's case wo n't just by handled by state investigators ; it 'll go through another layer of scrutiny by the district attorney 's office , @entity277 said			1
" @entity285 of @entity11 's @entity286 ( @entity40 ) has the exclusive authority to investigate all elements of the officer involved shooting -- forensics , interviews , technology feeds , etc. , " @entity277 wrote on his official blog			1
" this investigation is then turned directly over to the second layer of review , the @entity297 , who then makes a ruling on the question of whether there is criminal culpability on the part of my officer			0
" after the deaths of @entity235 and @entity238 , president @entity306 announced the " @entity308 on @entity309 , " aimed at strengthening trust between communities and officers and identifying which practices can be improved			0
the task force 's interim report , released this month , calls for independent investigations and independent special prosecutors in officer - related deaths			1
" the importance of making sure that the sense of accountability when , in fact , law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that i think communities across the board are going to need to consider , " @entity306 said			0
" we have a great opportunity , coming out of some great conflict and tragedy , to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel , rather than being embattled , feel fully supported			0
" @entity1 's @entity337 , @entity338 and @entity339 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 state investigators -- not local police -- will investigate @entity13 's killing by officer
@entity11 and @entity31 are the only states that require independent probes in such cases
12 states have pending legislation requiring outside entities to examine police involved shootings
