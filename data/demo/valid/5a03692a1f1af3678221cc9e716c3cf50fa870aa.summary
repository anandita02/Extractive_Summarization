@entity0 is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that threatens to unravel decades of @entity0 integration and derail the world 's recovery from the great recession			2
to understand this crisis , let 's compare two countries			2
country a is a small nation with a long history of tax evasion , government debt defaults and a dysfunctional business and regulatory climate			0
it allows workers to retire in their 50s , and pays double pensions when they do			0
it lied about its budget to get into the eurozone			0
@entity25 is a large , historically powerful nation with a record of low government debt			0
@entity25 even ran budget surpluses , including a 2 % surplus just before the financial crisis hit in 2008			0
it entered the eurozone with an honest accounting of its finances			0
if you guessed that country a is @entity38 , you are correct			2
if you believe @entity38 has caused the crisis in @entity0 because of its fiscal irresponsibility , then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter			1
but what do we make of fiscally responsible country b ? its virtuousness must mean it is weathering the crisis			0
and it must be @entity50 , right ? wrong			0
far from prospering , @entity51 is doing terribly			2
@entity51 's unemployment rate is 23.7 % , down from a high of almost 27 % in 2013			2
more than a fifth of its workers have been jobless for the last four years			0
more than half of its young people are out of work and have been for years			0
there is regularly talk of a lost generation in @entity51 and @entity38			1
like @entity38 , @entity51 's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout ( although a much smaller one ) to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing			1
@entity51 's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to gdp ratio has shot up dramatically			1
if @entity38 and @entity51 have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence , what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in ? the answer is not fiscal virtue			1
something else is going on			0
that something else , in large part , is the euro			1
joining the eurozone meant @entity51 and @entity38 gave up the power to create money , the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness , and the power to set interest rates			1
these are not trivial concessions , especially in a currency union like the euro where transfers between rich and poor sectors of the economy are limited , strict budget rules deny individual countries the flexibility to react to a crisis , and trade between euro - area nations is severely imbalanced			2
the inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s , @entity51 and @entity38 could n't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies			1
the over-heating was largely caused , by the way , by the frenzied ( and ultimately reckless ) lending in both countries by @entity50 and other core @entity0 banks			0
the @entity115 set interest rates in line with economic conditions in @entity50 and @entity118 that proved too low for @entity51 and @entity38 ( and @entity119 )			1
read : 25 people to blame for the financial crisis the over-heating of the @entity38 and @entity51 economies led to inflation and investment bubbles			1
as those bubbles burst , the banks neared collapse , and their rescue led ultimately to a sovereign debt crisis			0
the inability of @entity51 and @entity38 to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in @entity0 or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the @entity137			1
strict budget rules of @entity140 membership also required @entity51 and @entity38 to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the @entity144			1
they were required to raise taxes and cut spending even as unemployment reached astronomical levels			0
@entity150 helped create a depression of historic magnitude in @entity38 and a severe recession in @entity51			1
the policies also created runaway public debt			0
@entity38 's debt is now 175 % of gdp			2
@entity51 's debt to gdp ratio is 100 % -- a level not seen in @entity51 in more than 100 years			2
because @entity51 and @entity38 can not devalue the euro , the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation			1
this means @entity38 and @entity51 are in for years of high unemployment , reduced living standards , falling wages and deflation			1
in other words , massive impoverization			0
@entity172 , head of the @entity115 , famously said : " the euro is forever			0
" that may or may not be so , but it does n't mean that countries like @entity38 and @entity51 should stay in the euro forever			1
contrary to popular opinion , this crisis can not be explained away with a moral tale of @entity38 fiscal irresponsibility			1
the facts suggest otherwise .			0

if @entity38 and @entity51 have such different approaches to fiscal prudence , @entity184 asks why both are in crisis ?
something else is going on , she says : that something else , in large part , is the euro
