@entity2 @entity0 is fast becoming the go - to @entity4 city for some of @entity7 's biggest hitters			1
@entity8 is filming his latest opus " silence " there , and @entity11 director @entity10 chose @entity0 over seven other @entity4 cities for his sci - fi thriller " @entity15 , " starring @entity14			1
and this may " @entity19 " star @entity18 will begin filming in the city for a movie project			2
tasked with attracting international film makers , @entity23 , head of the @entity24 , said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year , up from 56 in 2013			1
" we hope the whole island can be like a big studio , " she told @entity1 while in @entity2 thursday			0
it was n't always this way			0
for years , @entity37 , while home to acclaimed filmmakers like @entity35 and @entity36 , was overlooked in favor of its ritzier neighbors @entity2 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
and even when @entity7 came knocking , the city did n't always have its act together			0
the producers of " @entity46 , " released in 2006 , had wanted to film at @entity0 , at that time the world 's tallest skyscraper			2
but faced with red tape and reluctance , they ended up choosing the 53 - story @entity51 for @entity54 's memorable bungee jump			0
" we lost an opportunity for the world to get to know @entity0 , " says @entity23			0
@entity23 's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it was n't until director @entity61 , who was born in @entity37 , filmed the @entity66 - winning hit " @entity65 " on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot			1
@entity61 filmed the memorable and technically difficult scenes of a shipwrecked boy and a tiger at a purpose - built facility at abandoned airport in the @entity37 city of @entity73			2
with its relatively unknown cityscape , @entity37 can also function as a generic @entity4 backdrop			0
the island , which was a @entity77 colony , is already being used as a stand - in for @entity77			2
@entity77 director @entity79 used @entity37 's high - speed rail system in a bullet - strewn action sequence for crime drama " @entity82 , " which competed at the @entity83			1
@entity77 rail authorities turned him away			0
and @entity8 's " silence , " due to release in 2016 , is a historic drama about two @entity87 priests who travel to @entity77			1
@entity37 is also a popular alternative to @entity90 , where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene			1
@entity2 director @entity96 used both @entity37 and @entity90 as locations in " @entity98			1
" dubbed @entity90 's " titanic , " it focuses on a ship that sank when the @entity102 government fled @entity90 for @entity37 in 1949 as the @entity103 took over -- a sensitive period in @entity90 history			1
@entity37 and @entity90 are still governed separately			2
@entity90 authorities asked @entity96 to tone down the heroics of a @entity102 soldier , according to the @entity109 -- not something that @entity37 would ever require , says @entity23			2
the commission offers incentives for international film crews			1
up to $ 2 million is available per movie -- half of that as a cash subsidy			0
but just as important is the island 's versatility as a location , says @entity23			0
while many of the film crews are from neighboring @entity4 countries , the city has hosted crews from @entity126 and @entity127 , while the @entity128 shot some of its newly released drama " @entity132 " in the city			1
" it 's a small island			0
within half an hour , you can go from the streets to the mountains to the sea			0

@entity0 is attracting more international film crews
@entity8 is shooting his latest movie in the city
@entity37 often acts as a stand in for @entity90 and @entity77
