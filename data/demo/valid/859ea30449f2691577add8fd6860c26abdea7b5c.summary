it is now generally accepted that @entity3 first officer @entity2 did indeed lock his captain out of the cockpit , put their airplane into a steep descent , and then sit back and wait calmly for the end to arrive			1
he did it with premeditation , having discarded a doctor 's note that would have excused him from work that day			0
he joins the short and infamous list of airline pilots , a handful over the past two decades , who have used their airplanes to combine suicide with mass murder			1
why is this thought at once so fascinating and so horrifying ? it is because of the incompatibility between what we want to believe about flying and what we now see			0
air travel presents itself as a highly controlled , stringently professional activity , stripped of every unpredictable element			0
flight crews wear military - style uniforms not because they could not fly equally well in street clothes , but because uniforms convey to passengers a subliminal suggestion that they are of a different breed , as far from ordinary folk as a world - class athlete is from a duffer			0
not only are pilots smarter and better - trained than ordinary people , those stripes and caps say , but they also must be less forgetful than we , less distractible , better rested , not prone to irritability or sadness or smoldering resentments			1
like soldiers , they must be just a little bit robotic , efficient , brave and purified of the trash that infests the souls of common humans			0
because they have earned their stripes , we feel safe -- even when it seems impossible for us to understand , or apparently for anyone to explain , what keeps those huge metal contraptions up in the air			0
the truth , as the voluminous history of airplane accidents reveals , is that pilots are not different from other people			1
they can be careless , lazy , inattentive and reckless			0
they can drink too much			0
when pilots talk among themselves , the mistakes , the close calls , the disasters averted by sheer luck are favorite topics			1
but if pilots slip up in little ways from time to time , the sweeping drama of aviation , in which they are the actors and we the audience , eclipses their faults			1
besides , most flying is routine -- hours of boredom , the cliché goes , punctuated by moments of sheer terror			0
the glitches have long since been ironed out , and the airplanes are so wonderfully engineered that they usually protect even the worst pilot from himself			2
nor are pilots of a higher moral type than the rest of us			1
despite the pieties they occasionally utter , pilots do not consciously shoulder the burden of hundreds of lives or feel more responsible for a full airplane than for an empty one			2
pilots , by and large , are proud			2
they identify with the airplane ; it is an extension and enlargement of the self , and the pilot feels the same motive to deliver it safely to its destination as you feel when driving a car on a crowded freeway			2
a pilot values a smooth landing because it demonstrates skill , not because the people in back are still alive			2
the greatest guarantee you have that your pilot is devoted to your safety is the fact that he or she is in the airplane with you			2
so we should not be overly astonished if from time to time a pilot does something completely incompatible with our confidence			0
pilots are drawn from the diverse pool of human types			1
the human mind is the blackest of boxes ; no one , neither colleague nor psychologist , can reliably peer inside it			1
desperate , cataclysmic acts occur almost daily all over the world ; why should they not occur , once in a long while , in cockpits ? perhaps , with time , we will understand better who @entity2 was and what he did			1
today , we still know very little .			0

*experts* *suspect* first officer @entity2 locked pilot out of the cockpit of plane
@entity154 : pilots do *n't* exist on different moral plane than the rest of us , and the human mind is the blackest of boxes
