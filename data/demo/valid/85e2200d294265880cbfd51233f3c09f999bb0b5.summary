the sounds recorded on one of the " black boxes " recovered from downed @entity4 9525 firms up investigators ' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane			0
" for @entity13 's sake , open the door ! " capt. @entity15 screamed as he banged on the cockpit door , pleading with the co-pilot			2
thirteen minutes later , the plane slammed into the @entity18			0
the audio from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has not been released , but the @entity23 newspaper @entity22 published sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording			1
@entity0 translated @entity22 's report -- which the newspaper says is based on the 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder -- but can not independently verify the information			1
@entity35 's accident investigation agency , @entity36 , told @entity0 that the agency is " dismayed " by the voice recording leak to @entity22			1
@entity39 , a spokeswoman for the agency , said the leak could not have come from a @entity36 agent			1
she said the agency considers the report mere " voyeurism			2
" according to @entity22 's report , @entity15 told co-pilot @entity46 that he did n't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff			1
@entity46 tells him he can go anytime			1
@entity46 is believed to have locked the pilot of @entity51 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains , @entity18 authorities have said			1
the flight took off 20 minutes late			2
after reaching cruising altitude , @entity15 asked @entity46 to prepare the landing			1
once that 's finished , @entity46 again tells the captain he " can go anytime			1
" there is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says , " you can take over			0
" at 10:29 a.m. , air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend			0
three minutes later , air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit , warning of the " sink rate , " @entity22 reported			1
@entity15 begs @entity46 to let him in			1
passengers then begin to scream , according to the transcript obtained by @entity22			2
a loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters ( almost 23,000 feet )			0
a minute and half later and 2,000 meters ( about 6,500 feet ) lower to the ground , an alarm says " terrain -- pull up ! " " open the damn door ! " the pilot says			0
it 's 10:38 , and the plane is at 4,000 meters ( about 13,000 feet )			2
@entity46 's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder , according to @entity22 's report			1
two minutes later , investigators think they hear the plane 's right wing scrape a mountaintop			0
screams can be heard one final time			0
cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations			0
they 're never officially released , according to @entity0 aviation reporter @entity102			0
@entity103 called it " unbelievable " that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner			0
communications between air traffic control and a plane 's cockpit can be downloaded privately , but that 's less common in @entity112 than it is in the @entity113			0
an edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident			0
although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing			2
that device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight			1
@entity127 , lead investigator for the @entity18 inquiry , said on saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point			0
but @entity18 authorities have said that @entity46 appeared to have crashed @entity4 9525 deliberately into the @entity18 on tuesday as it flew from @entity135 , @entity136 , toward @entity137 , @entity23 , with 150 people on board			1
much attention has focused on @entity46 's state of mind since then , with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues			1
@entity46 , 27 , passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a @entity23 aviation source told @entity0			1
an official with @entity148 , which owns @entity4 , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health			0
the official also said that the company was never given any indication @entity46 was depressed , and that if he went to a doctor on his own , he would have been required to self - report if deemed unfit to fly			2
a @entity137 clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , " concerning a diagnosis			0
" but the @entity159 said it had not treated @entity46 for depression			1
the speculation about @entity46 ' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his @entity137 apartment			2
the note , which was " slashed , " said @entity46 was not able to do his job , city prosecutor @entity166 said friday			2
the fact that investigators found " ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , " prosecutors said			0
@entity4 corroborated that assertion , saying it had never received a sick note from @entity46			2
a handful of publications , citing unnamed sources , have reported that @entity46 suffered from various psychological maladies			1
@entity0 has not been able to confirm these reports			0
@entity46 suffered from " generalized anxiety disorder , " and from severe depression in the past , @entity187 newspaper reported sunday , citing sources close to the investigation			1
in 2010 , @entity46 received injections of antipsychotic medication , the paper said			2
he was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters , but it 's unclear when that happened , according to @entity187			1
the newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes , which forbade him from working from march 16 to march 29			0
the @entity207 and @entity208 , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that @entity46 suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer			1
a subsequent report from the @entity207 on saturday , citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , said @entity46 sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk			1
however , an official with @entity148 , said that if @entity46 had vision problems , they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination			2
authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic , according to the @entity207			0
citing an unidentified senior investigator , @entity23 newspaper @entity228 said that @entity46 suffered from a severe " psychosomatic illness " and that @entity23 police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition			1
@entity46 suffered from a " severe subjective burnout syndrome " and from severe depression , the source told the newspaper			1
news reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment			0
investigators are expected to question his relatives , friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside			0
@entity46 had a girlfriend , a teacher at a school in @entity137 not far from his apartment , according to @entity23 media			1
who was co-pilot @entity46 ? dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town , @entity262 , @entity35			1
most of the people on the plane were from @entity23 and @entity136			2
relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site , in the village of @entity272			0
flowers have been laid there , in the shadow of the snow - covered peaks of the @entity18			0
the mayor of one local community said he had seen @entity46 's father on thursday evening , describing him as " a man in deep distress			1
" " we get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders , " @entity283 , the mayor of @entity284 , said saturday			0
" i can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken , " @entity283 said			0
" he had so much emotion in him			0
" @entity0 's @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 contributed to this report .			0
