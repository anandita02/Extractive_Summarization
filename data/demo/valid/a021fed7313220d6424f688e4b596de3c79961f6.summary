five @entity1 women stand tall in a boxing ring , slowly winding strapping around their hands			1
a spotlight is trained on them and the audience draws close , hanging on their every word			2
" how can we be truthful if we have to hide out of shame , feel humiliated for feeling , for saying , doing , thinking as we please ? how can that be freedom , how can that be truth ? " performed at @entity14 's wow -- women of the @entity16 -- @entity27 's " @entity24 , no heart , no glory , " tells the true story of @entity1 female boxers from @entity19 in the north of @entity21 , and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers			1
the critically acclaimed show -- in which the women stamp , dance , shout , swear , punch , and even crowd surf -- was partly inspired by @entity34 , a former @entity36 national champion , and one of @entity36 's first @entity1 female boxers			1
her journey to success was n't easy -- as a victim of bullying at the age of 13 she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother			1
" i got bullied quite a lot growing up , my dad 's @entity50 and my mum 's @entity52 , " @entity48 told @entity2			2
" i got stick from both sides , from white and black people			2
i felt like i was n't accepted			2
i used to move schools so many times just to feel accepted			2
" people would stay stuff about how i looked ... everyone said that 's a boy 's sport , what are you doing that for ? you 're going to look like a man , like a transsexual			0
" i was bullied from such a young age , i felt like it was never going to stop			0
boxing helped me to control that anger			1
" it was a transformative experience for @entity48 -- she went from being quiet , having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations , and thereby build self confidence			1
" instead of punching someone in the face i 'd punch the bag , " she added			0
" if anyone came up to me and said anything i could just walk away from it -- whereas before i 'd just straight punch them in the face or something			0
so it 's helped me a lot with discipline			0
" it 's sometimes hard to imagine @entity48 as a boxer -- her movements are calm and assured , and a kind smile is never far from her lips			0
" boxing has made me the person i am today , and i 'm so proud of the person i am , " said the 20 - year - old trailblazer , who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps			1
" i 've had a lot of girls -- not just @entity107 girls -- coming up to me and asking , how do you stop people saying it 's a boy 's sport ? how can you convince your parents to let you box ? " while boxing for many is just a sport -- albeit a violent one -- when it comes to women and @entity1 participating it can feel more like a cause , with @entity48 often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls			1
" what 's the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes ? when we 're in that ring we look like boxers -- we do n't look like a girl or a boy			1
" you come into that gym , you come into that show , you come into that ring thinking i 'm a boxer , not that i 'm a girl or i 'm a boy			0
" the role of @entity139 -- the first ever female boxer to win an @entity141 -- has also been key in the fight for acceptance			2
@entity48 tells the story of how several years ago her coach @entity145 , who also worked with @entity147 , originally refused to train women -- that is , until he turned up to coach the @entity150 ( believing they 'd be men ) only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work			1
" that 's the day he met @entity139 , " recalls @entity48 with a laugh			0
" he said from that day he thought girls were better boxers -- because they like to listen			1
" since @entity147 ' success at the @entity160 , females boxing once a week increased by 79 % according to a 2013 @entity21 study , but even the production of " no guts , no heart , @entity165 " highlighted the barriers women potentially face			1
cast member and aspiring medical student @entity168 said there was a girl who had wanted to participate in the show , but was ultimately prevented from doing so by her relatives			1
" it was n't even the boxing and it was n't even the speech , it was the dancing we do in the ring			2
i 'm incredibly lucky to be able to do this , and i was just so sad for her			0
you know there are certain women out there who ca n't do what we 're doing right now			0
" " i think that 's what makes me even more passionate about doing this -- we want to give them a voice and give them a reason , so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this			1
" if women do feel restricted by their religion or gender , @entity168 urged them to take things step by step			1
" go for it , just go for it			0
i think maybe talk to your parents first , and just tell them @entity208 , @entity209 , this is what i want to do , i want to box , i want to dance , i want to act , or whatever she wants to do			0
" tell them , you know what ? its ok what i 'm doing , i 'm not going to be going out of my boundaries and doing bad things , i 'm going to stick to my limits and stick to my religion , it 's not harming anyone			0
" my parents would say , if you 're happy , we 're happy			0
i think anyone 's parents would say that would n't they ? " the first step is trying it and opening that door			0
once you can open it an inch you can open it a mile			0

" @entity24 , no heart , @entity165 " is a play by @entity27 that tells the true story of @entity1 female boxers
the performance was partly inspired by former @entity36 national champion @entity34 who experienced bullying and *discrimination*
" we want to give them a voice and give them a reason , so they know they can have confidence " says cast member @entity168 about girls in boxing
