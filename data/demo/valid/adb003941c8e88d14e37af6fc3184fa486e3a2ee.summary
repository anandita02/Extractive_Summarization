@entity1 's tractor - trailer sized @entity4 spacecraft will snuggle up to @entity5 on friday , getting close enough to be pulled into orbit and to complete the first mission to a dwarf planet			1
" i 'm just delighted that @entity4 is now on the doorstep of @entity5 , " @entity9 , director of @entity1 's planetary science division said in a news conference on monday			1
@entity4 is expected to begin orbiting @entity5 around 7:20 a.m. et , but @entity1 says it may take an hour or two to confirm it			1
@entity5 was discovered in 1801 ( @entity13 was n't found until 1930 ) and was the first object found in our solar system 's main asteroid belt between @entity18 and @entity19			1
it 's about 310 million miles from @entity21 and was initially classified as planet , then later demoted to an asteroid , only to be reclassified again as a dwarf planet			1
the early images from @entity4 already have mission scientists excited			1
" @entity5 has really surprised us , " said @entity27 , @entity4 's deputy principal investigator			1
" the first images have produced some really puzzling features			0
" one of the puzzles -- two bright white spots that showed up in photographs taken by @entity4 in february			1
" these spots were extremely surprising to the team , and they have been puzzling to the team and to everybody who 's seen them			2
" the spots are in a 57 - mile wide ( 92 kilometer ) crater			0
the spot in the center of the crater is about twice as bright as the spot on the side of the crater			0
" this extreme brightness was really unexpected , " @entity43 said			0
the @entity45 is " really , really excited about this feature because it is unique in the solar system			0
" @entity43 says the brightness is consistent with highly reflective materials such as ice or salts			0
this might help add more credence to a discovery made in 2014 by @entity57 's @entity56 infrared space observatory			2
the telescope detected water vapor around @entity5 coming from the same area where the spots are located			2
" it might be related to that water vapor emission , " @entity43 said			0
@entity56 's scientists also said their research showed @entity5 has an atmosphere			1
@entity43 said her team is keen to confirm that			0
scientists expect to learn more as @entity4 is gradually lowered to about 235 miles above the surface of @entity5 in december			1
" the mystery will be solved , " she said			0
but @entity5 seems to have lots of oddities			2
" we see many strange features , " @entity43 said			0
" we see smooth areas , some areas that are chaotically fractured and we see craters of all sizes			0
" one of the other things scientists noticed is how round @entity5 is			2
being round is very important because it is the main characteristic of a planet -- a title that @entity5 had -- then lost			1
@entity5 was demoted to an asteroid because 19th century astronomers could n't be sure it was round			2
but it was bumped up to a dwarf planet when that category was created in 2006			1
according to the @entity94 -- the group that came up with the definition -- a dwarf planet is similar to the eight main planets ( @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity21 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 ) except it has a lot of other stuff orbiting with it around the sun. the @entity94 recognizes five dwarf planets : @entity108 , @entity13 , @entity5 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
scientists say there could be many more of these small worlds that have n't been discovered			0
@entity4 was launched on september 27 , 2007 , from @entity115 , @entity116			2
its journey has taken it past @entity18 and on a short layover at the asteroid @entity121			0
on friday , @entity4 will make its closest approach yet to @entity5 , flying about 25,000 miles from it , according to @entity125 , project manager for the @entity4 at @entity1 's @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128			1
" that 's about 10 times closer than the moon is to the @entity21 , " he said			0
but the beautiful images coming in from @entity4 will stop for awhile			2
" we 're now on the dark side , so we 're going to have a blackout for about the next month until we get back over toward the lit side of the body , " he said			0
but he says the " floodgates will open " when its main science mission starts in april			0
@entity4 will stay in orbit around @entity5 for years , even after its primary mission ends in june 2016			1
but at some point , it will run out of hydrazine , the fuel used to guide the spacecraft			0
between now and then -- mission managers hope @entity4 will help solve the mysteries of @entity5 and add to our knowledge of how our solar system formed .			1

@entity1 's @entity4 arrives friday at @entity5
the spacecraft is the first to visit a dwarf planet
