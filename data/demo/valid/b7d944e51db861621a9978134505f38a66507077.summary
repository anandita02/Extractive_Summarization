@entity1 star @entity0 will not race in the season - opening @entity4 @entity3 on the advice of doctors treating him for the effects of a high - speed crash			1
the double world champion was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his @entity13 at the penultimate winter test in @entity16 last month			1
the @entity17 is now recovering at home but doctors have indicated returning to racing in @entity21 three weeks after after the high impact could be too risky			0
@entity0 commented on @entity23 : " it will be tough not to be in @entity4 , but i understand the recommendations			1
a second impact in less than 21 days " no "			0
@entity13 explained in a statement : " @entity0 's doctors have recommended to him that , following the concussion he sustained on february 22nd , for the time being he should seek to limit as far as is possible any environmental risk factors that could potentially result in his sustaining another concussion			1
" @entity32 -- who effectively lost his seat to @entity0 when the @entity17 returned to @entity13 after his @entity35 exit -- will race alongside @entity36 in the @entity4 @entity3 on march 15th			1
@entity0 's return to the starting grid in @entity13 colors has been delayed by his freakish crash at the @entity41 , home to the @entity42 @entity3			1
@entity13 had explained that @entity0 's " accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time			2
" turn three , where the accident took place , is an area of the circuit where cross winds are known to affect the balance of the cars			0
the 33 - year - old posted a video on social media on friday to thank his fans for his support and update them on his condition			0
standing in a garden , a smiling @entity0 said : " as you can see i 'm completely fine			0
i will rest and keep you updated next week with progress and see you very soon on the track			0
" but his return to the racing asphalt has now been delayed until at least the @entity66 @entity3 at the end of march despite doctors saying he has no symptoms of illness			2
" having performed an exhaustive series of tests and scans -- some of them as recently as yesterday evening -- @entity0 's doctors have informed him that they find him asymptomatic of any medical issue ; that they see no evidence whatsoever of any injury , " @entity13 said in a statement			2
" they therefore describe him as entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives alike			0
" however , in order to limit the risk of a secondary concussion @entity0 has accepted the advice not to race but has continued his preparations for the new @entity1 season			1
" @entity0 's doctors acknowledge that he feels fit and well , and that he regards himself as ready to race , " the statement continued			0
" they are comfortable with the fact that he has already recommenced physical training , with a view to preparing for a return to the cockpit of his @entity13 - @entity96 car for the @entity66 @entity3			1
indeed , his doctors are supportive of that ambition			0
" @entity0 chose to leave @entity35 at the end of the 2014 season and rejoin @entity13 , which is also renewing its technical partnership with @entity102 engine manufacturer @entity96 for 2015			1
the @entity17 -- regarded by his peers as the best driver on the grid -- is chasing a third world crown but , so far , he has not had chance to gauge the possibilities of realizing that ambition with @entity13			0
early reliability problems meant @entity0 had only completed 117 laps in the @entity113 race car before his preseason was curtailed by the crash .			2
