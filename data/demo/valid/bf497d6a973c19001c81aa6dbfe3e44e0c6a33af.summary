two police officers shot and wounded while standing guard outside the @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 early thursday were deliberately targeted in what a police official called an " ambush			1
" such ambush - style attacks were the leading circumstance in the surging number of shooting deaths of law enforcement officers , according to the nonprofit , @entity16 - based @entity15			1
the shootings were a chilling low point in the protests in the @entity21 suburb since a @entity3 police officer shot and killed 18 - year - old @entity23 in august			1
the demonstrators were out again late wednesday -- in response to the announcement hours earlier of @entity3 police chief @entity28 's resignation -- when shots rang out from a hill about 125 yards from where the protesters had gathered , according to witnesses			1
@entity21 county police chief @entity34 said the shootings were an " ambush " intended " for whatever nefarious reason " to inflict harm on the officers			1
the officers -- one shot in the face , the other in the shoulder -- have been released from the hospital			1
@entity46 attorney general @entity45 decried the shootings as a " heinous assault ( that ) was inexcusable and repugnant			0
" calling the shooting a " cowardly action , " @entity45 said , " i condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms , and the @entity51 will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities			0
" the number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50 % in 2014 , the law enforcement group said in a report released in december			1
many of those shootings occurred during police interactions with suspects such as traffic stops , responses to disturbances or attempted arrests			1
such was the case in @entity75 , @entity76 , on tuesday , when deputy u.s. marshal @entity77 was killed in an exchange of gunfire after going to arrest a fugitive murder suspect at a motel			2
however , ambushes were the largest single category of circumstances in the shooting deaths of officers in 2014 , according to the group 's report			1
fifty officers were killed by firearms -- 15 in ambush attacks -- in 2014 , the @entity15 said			1
that 's compared with five ambushes among 32 shooting deaths in 2013 and six ambush deaths during 2012 , according to the @entity96			1
but those ambush numbers have trended higher before in previous years : the @entity96 counted 15 officer deaths by ambush each year in 2011 , 2010 and 2009			1
ambush situations were the biggest category of circumstance behind 543 officers feloniously killed from 2002 to 2011 : 23.2 %			1
ambush killings are nothing new			2
the @entity96 defines two types : one is by " entrapment and premeditation , " which is a scenario " where the officer was lured into danger as the result of conscious consideration and planning			0
these attacks are generally accomplished from cover or hiding ; however , they can occur without cover or hiding , " the agency said			0
the second are ambushes of " unprovoked attacks , " which are " generally accomplished without hiding ; however , they can occur with or without cover , " the @entity96 said			2
@entity122 , a consultant and former @entity124 detective , said officers could be second - guessing themselves as scrutiny of the police increases			1
" if an officer is afraid to immediately react the way he 's supposed to , " he said , " that could cost him his life			0
" according to the @entity136 2014 report , 126 federal , state , local , tribal and territorial officers died in the line of duty in 2014 , compared with 102 and 123 the previous two years			1
most of the on - duty deaths considered " non-felonious " were from traffic accidents or health reasons			0
@entity1 has not analyzed each case and can not authenticate the group 's findings			0
after the findings were released in december , @entity45 said : " these troubling statistics underscore the very real dangers that @entity46 's brave law enforcement officers face every time they put on their uniforms			2
each loss is both tragic and unacceptable -- a beloved father , mother , son or daughter who never came home to their loved ones			0
" he said that the @entity51 is doing its own analysis of officer deaths in 2014 " so we can mitigate risks in the future			2
" the report 's release came amid simmering distrust and tension between police and some communities across the country			2
it was published less than two weeks after the december 20 ambush killing of two @entity175 police officers			1
@entity176 , 28 , approached officers @entity177 and @entity178 as they sat in their marked patrol car in @entity181 on december 20 and shot them to death			1
he killed himself shortly afterward			2
the police memorial fund invoked the memories of @entity177 and @entity178 ' deaths in a december statement			2
" with the increasing number of ambush - style attacks against our officers , i am deeply concerned that a growing anti-government sentiment in @entity46 is influencing weak - minded individuals to launch violent assaults against the men and women working to enforce our laws and keep our nation safe , " said @entity189 , chairman and ceo of the police fund			1
" enough is enough , " he said			0
" we need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness			0
" that angry rhetoric is n't confined to the case of @entity3 -- or of @entity211 , @entity175 , where the death of @entity213 in july after police attempted to subdue him spurred national protests and preceded the slayings of @entity177 and @entity178 , said @entity217 , a spokesman for the memorial fund			1
@entity217 said the uptick in ambush - style attacks was " punctuated " by the @entity175 officers ' slayings , but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the fund			1
they included : in @entity230 in june , @entity228 and his wife surprised two police officers as they ate lunch , shooting them to death			1
witnesses said the @entity235 placed a " @entity238 " flag and a swastika on one officer 's body			0
the couple then died in a murder - suicide as police closed in			2
in @entity244 , @entity245 , in july , police said a man assaulted a @entity248 's security guard and took his gun in order to carry out the ambush - style killing of an officer , according to the @entity254			1
two @entity256 troopers were ambushed and shot outside police barracks in @entity258 in september			1
the hunt for the alleged killer , @entity260 , lasted almost seven weeks			0
he was captured at an abandoned airport on october 30			0
@entity260 was hit with terrorism charges in november for allegedly admitting that he shot the officers to change the government and " wake people up			1
" but the number of shootings by police officers also is on the rise			1
according to data collected by the @entity96 , there were 461 justifiable homicides in 2013 -- the highest level since 1994 and the most recent year available			2
the figures are incomplete , however , because the shootings are self - reported and not all police departments provide them			2
the total number of fatal shootings by police officers is much higher -- 1,010 in 2013 and 1,134 last year , according to the nonprofit @entity280			1
the group started collecting the data in 2013			2
its source of information is different from the @entity96 's			0
the group 's founder , @entity285 , said the figures create a toxic environment for police , as well as suspects			2
" when it comes to @entity293 , that people are addressing the problems with violence , the numbers are always going to go up on both sides , " he said			0
this week , @entity299 residents took to the streets to protest the police killing of @entity302 , a 19 - year - old who was unarmed			0
@entity302 's shooting was the fourth involving an officer in @entity299 in the last three weeks			0
the others hardly made headlines : one involved an armed robbery , another a domestic abuser who put a knife to his girlfriend 's throat , and another involved an assailant with a fake gun			0
last april , @entity319 police officer @entity318 shot @entity320 , a mentally ill man , more than a dozen times			1
the officer said he opened fire when @entity320 grabbed his baton and struck him with it			0
@entity318 was not charged criminally			0
instead , he was fired for not following protocol			0
@entity319 county sheriff @entity327 accused politicians of fueling what he called an " assault " on policing			0
" war has been declared on the @entity46 police officer , " @entity327 told @entity1 on friday			0
" and i 'm tired of politicians taking all of the maladies of the @entity46 ghetto and blaming them on the @entity46 police officer			0
... they jumped in , early on , instead of offering calm words , they threw gas on an already smoldering fire			0
" experts say the numbers alone do n't tell the whole story			0
" we need to know the circumstances in each individual case , " said @entity122 , the consultant and former @entity124 detective			0
@entity1 's @entity349 contributed to this report .			0
