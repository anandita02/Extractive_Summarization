@entity0 has set the stage for a potentially season - defining week for @entity3 , scoring both goals as his team went four points clear at the top of the @entity9 league on saturday			1
the 2 - 0 win at tiny @entity11 , a side playing in @entity13 for the first time and which has now lost eight games in a row , may not seem like an unexpected achievement			2
but , with a @entity20 last - 16 decider at home to @entity22 on wednesday and then the " @entity25 " crunch clash with bitter rival @entity24 next sunday , every win is vital at this stage of the campaign			1
" we 're going into the @entity25 as leaders and in perfect form , " @entity3 coach @entity28 said			1
" but first we have to focus on @entity22 because qualification is at stake			1
then we 'll see what happens at the weekend			2
" @entity0 has now scored 43 goals this season , first netting a 31st - minute penalty after @entity38 unluckily handled the @entity40 's blocked shot and then bulleting in a header from @entity43 's corner 10 minutes after the restart			2
" @entity11 did n't look like a team that has just lost seven in a row , " said @entity28 , who welcomed back @entity46 star @entity45 from suspension to resume his role up front with @entity0 and @entity50			2
" they played good football and they fully deserved their great start to the season			2
i do n't think they 'll have any trouble avoiding relegation			0
" the result puts even more pressure on second - placed @entity24 to win sunday 's home clash with @entity65			1
the @entity68 champion 's coach @entity66 has been criticized after a poor run of results since the turn of the year , while world - record signing @entity72 has particularly been vilified by national sports paper @entity74 following tuesday 's home defeat by @entity77			2
@entity24 can take some small consolation in the fact that city rival @entity80 could only draw 0 - 0 at @entity81 , meaning the defending champion stayed fourth in the table following @entity85 's 2 - 0 win over @entity86 on friday			1
@entity80 defender @entity87 was sent off in time added on at the end of the first half for a foul on @entity92			0
@entity94 's side hosts @entity96 club @entity95 on tuesday as it seeks to overturn a 1 - 0 deficit and seek to match last season 's achievement of reaching the @entity20 final			1
@entity3 , also looking to join @entity24 in the quarterfinals , faces a @entity22 side reeling after saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat by relegation - threatened @entity104			1
it left @entity106 's team five points behind @entity110 leader @entity108 , which has two games in hand ahead of sunday 's home clash with @entity114			0
" we must continue to fight but the chances of winning the title are far as things stand , " said @entity106 , whose team must overcome a 2 - 1 deficit at the @entity116 next week			0
" there is still a chance , but it is more difficult after this result			0
we needed to create more chances than we did and find more space in and around their defense			0
" the @entity128 refused to blame the referee for not awarding what appeared to be a clear penalty for @entity22 in the dying minutes , when @entity132 was brought down in the box			1
" was it a penalty ? maybe , but the referee decides these moments and i do n't think that was the most important thing in this game , " he said			0
" the issue for us at present is that we are not winning the games that we normally do , especially against teams we are expected to beat , and that is because we are not scoring goals			0
" @entity22 , seeking to retain its @entity110 title , is only one point ahead of third - placed @entity150 after @entity152 's team won 3 - 0 at home to @entity154 on saturday			1
the @entity156 side has now won four games in all competitions since suffering a shock 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity152 's former club @entity162 in the first leg of their last - 16 @entity20 tie last month			1
" we have to believe that we can do it , " the @entity165 said of tuesday 's trip to the principality			0
" this time @entity162 are favorites so we have to go there , give absolutely everything and come out of the game with that feeling			0
" @entity162 moved up to fourth in the @entity165 league on friday , beating nine - man @entity175 3 - 0 as @entity176 scored twice and @entity177 missed a penalty			2
@entity180 club @entity179 , another side in @entity20 action next week , went 14 points clear in @entity183 with a 1 - 0 win at mid-table @entity185 on saturday			1
@entity9 substitute @entity186 ended @entity185 's six - month unbeaten home run with a curling winner to maintain the @entity191 team 's momentum ahead of wednesday 's trip to @entity193			1
the @entity96 side , which trails 2 - 1 after the first leg thanks to goals from @entity186 and @entity197 , drew 0 - 0 at home to @entity199 saturday to remain in mid-table after a second successive scoreless draw in the @entity202			0
defending champion @entity203 moved 14 points clear at the top with a 4 - 0 win at @entity207 , as @entity209 striker @entity208 scored twice to add to his goal from the midweek @entity20 thrashing of @entity212			1
@entity213 , who netted twice in the 7 - 0 routing of the @entity216 side , opened the scoring while @entity218 bagged the second goal			0
third - placed @entity95 , meanwhile , triumphed 4 - 0 over @entity220 on friday , with @entity221 scoring two			0
@entity222 , eight points ahead of @entity95 , hosts second - bottom @entity224 on sunday			0
