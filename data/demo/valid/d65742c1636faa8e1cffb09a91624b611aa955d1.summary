@entity1 , @entity2 for residents of this town just across the bridge from @entity7 , it 's hard to understand how a @entity9 political fight could end up threatening the livelihood of people charged with securing the border			1
" what incentive do they have to keep protecting us if they 're not getting paid ? " asked @entity13 as she sat at a coffee shop with a friend			2
" the latest example of congressional dysfunction has real world implications here , where thousands of agents monitor the @entity26 border with @entity7			1
the agents , along with other employees vital to national security such as @entity31 screeners , will have to show up to work without being paid if @entity32 misses a friday deadline to keep the @entity34 funded			1
thousands of other agency workers will be furloughed			2
the employees are caught up in a fight over immigration policy			2
@entity39 want to tie funding for the department to legislation that would roll back president @entity44 's immigration executive orders -- a nonstarter for @entity46			2
the battle reached a fevered pitch last week when @entity32 narrowly missed a deadline to avoid a partial @entity34 shutdown , giving themselves an extension until march 6 to broker a deal			1
speaker @entity53 could try to avert another showdown by holding a vote as early as tuesday on a @entity34 bill that does n't touch @entity44 's immigration order			1
but the political intrigue is n't registering for some residents here			1
@entity60 , a nurse who works nights at a hospital , said she was n't concerned yet because she had n't read or heard anything about the potential shutdown			2
" me , personally , i peek into the news every now and then , but it 's things like @entity68 , you know , those big headline things , that i look at on the news , " she said			2
" none of my friends have been talking about ( the shutdown ) , and i have n't been keeping up with it			0
" at the coffee shop with @entity79 , @entity77 said he 'd heard of the potential shutdown but did n't feel unsafe			0
" i do n't know what 's going to necessarily happen to the department itself , " @entity77 said			0
" i do n't know how that 's going to affect the protection of the border or border patrol , but i guess we 're going to find out			1
" @entity88 said he was mad after hearing that @entity32 agreed to keep @entity34 running for only a few days			1
he said he wonders why lawmakers do n't realize how their decisions affect local areas			0
" they 're a bunch of incompetent men who just ca n't figure it out , " he said			0
" and i know not all of them are men , but say predominantly , old white men screwing up this country			0
" local employees of the @entity34 stationed along the border said they were n't allowed to speak to newsgroups on the record because of orders directly from @entity9			1
but speaking without attribution , they did express frustration with @entity32 for defunding their department in 2013 as part of the broader government shutdown and possibly again later this week if a longer term funding bill is n't passed			0
the agents argued they have families to feed and mortgages to pay , just like anyone else			0
@entity115 , the vice president of the local 3307 @entity116 , a union for border agents , echoed those sentiments			1
he said that in the @entity1 area , about 2,000 agents would be affected by this funding bill			1
he said the problem is in @entity9 , where @entity32 wo n't feel the direct effect of a possible funding gap			1
as a border patrol agent for 13 years who also felt the effect of the 2013 shutdown , he remembers how it went down last time			1
" it 's pretty much out of our hands " he said			0
" the sad part is that we 're the football in this political game , and we 're just caught in the middle getting tossed around while somebody is trying to push their own agenda , one way or the other			1
" in the meantime , he said he 's working with local agents to help them send letters to their mortgage companies to alert them of the possible problems because most of them are considered essential personnel and will have to continue working without a paycheck			0
for now , he said that 's all that the union can do to help			0
" at some point , people will jump ship , " he said			2
" i do n't think there 's going to be a rush for the door , but we will have some people that are gon na say ' enough is enough			2
this is twice in two years , and i 'm done with this			0
' " if a shutdown were to happen later this week , @entity115 said that nonessential personnel , such as administration positions in the department , would not report to work			0
agents would continue to work securing the border , but depending on how long the shutdown lasts , they 'd eventually have to work in some of the administrative positions as well to make up for employees who were furloughed			2
" most likely what will happen is that they 'll have to pull agents who do frontline work , processing work , or stuff in the station , " he said			0
" they 're going to have to backfill them -- you know somebody has to answer the phones at the front of the building			0
" he added that he believes the cartels in @entity7 are keeping up with @entity26 news so that they can take advantage in case @entity34 does shut down			1
" they know , " @entity115 said about anyone across the border hoping to bring people or drugs			1
" they scout us when our shift changes			0
they know everything that 's coming along			0
and when they see stuff like this , when it hits the media , they start mobilizing			0
" @entity1 mayor @entity207 agreed and said he believes cartels and gangs are more tuned in about what 's going on in @entity9 than his own constituents			1
" i would think there 's @entity214 guys listening to @entity9 right now , " he said			1
" if they think there 's a porous border , they 're going to come and make some money			2
" @entity220 says that @entity9 's actions have a " ripple effect " across the country , of which they should be more aware and considerate			1
" i do n't know about you , but i seriously doubt a congressman can go without a paycheck , " he said			0
" it 's a bipartisan problem , and they have to come up with a bipartisan solution , and they 're not			0

the political battle in @entity9 has real *economic* implications for @entity1 , @entity2
the border town is home to people who depend on their paychecks from their @entity34 jobs
