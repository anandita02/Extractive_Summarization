@entity1 three area residents were arrested and charged wednesday for allegedly operating four @entity4 schools for @entity6 and @entity7 students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a " pay - to - stay " scheme			1
the three educators collected as much as $ 6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from @entity16 and @entity7 , said federal prosecutors			1
the arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud , money laundering and other immigration offenses			1
an allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme , authorities said			1
@entity33 , 51 , of @entity34 , is the owner and manager and of the postsecondary schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud , authorities said			0
the two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense : they are @entity45 , also known as @entity46 , 39 , of @entity1 who assisted in the operation and management of the schools ; and @entity50 , also known as @entity51 , 32 , of @entity1 , a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school			1
@entity33 , who also went by @entity56 and @entity57 , is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence , as well as two counts of money laundering , prosecutors said			0
the three defendants and their attorneys could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday			2
" immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules , " acting u.s. attorney @entity65 said in a statement			0
" in this case , officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country			2
this type of fraud against the @entity81 will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system , " the federal prosecutor said			2
three of the schools are in @entity1 ' @entity90 neighborhood : @entity91 / @entity92 ; @entity94 , an @entity95 ( @entity96 ) ; and the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , authorities said			0
the fourth school is currently operating in @entity99 , @entity4 : @entity100 and @entity101 , authorities said			2
" what we 've broken up is a pay - to - stay scheme , " said @entity102 , special agent in charge of the @entity1 office of @entity105			0
" that 's a scheme where institutions purport to be schools , but are really not doing any education whatsoever , " he said			0
" any scheme where someone gains access to the @entity81 through fraud is also a national security vulnerability , " @entity102 said			0
" although we do n't have any information that any of these people wish to do harm to the @entity81 , the point is anyone could take advantage of a vulnerability like this			0
which is why it is so important that we identify these vulnerabilities and shut them down			0
" @entity129 was located on the fifth floor of a @entity1 office tower near the @entity90 neighborhood , but @entity134 agents said they found the school " abandoned " during their raid on wednesday			1
the agents allowed @entity2 to attend the raid			1
the school featured classrooms , administrative offices and a small library , but no one occupied the spaces			2
in fact , the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set , filled with props and decorations , but no actors			1
in one small room , a cd player serenaded empty desks with classical music			0
the tiny library featured @entity156 and @entity157 pennants			0
the television was n't even plugged in			0
one federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older , in their 30s , 40s and 50s			1
@entity165 's 2011 - 2012 catalog describes the facility as an @entity167 as second language school and states " it is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand @entity167 in all facets of life by providing a top quality @entity177 educational environment , " according to a copy of the document on the website of the @entity182			1
" our enthusiastic and qualified instructors concern themselves with teaching a rigorous , but innovative curriculum of interactive and beneficial courses and materials leading to higher toefl scores and admission to @entity81 colleges and universities , " the catalog says			0
another document with the state bureau indicates @entity165 had a 73 % graduation rate in 2011 and a 60 % rate in 2010			0
but the indictment alleges that students actually lived @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			2
the schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the @entity81 , authorities said			1
the document , called a form @entity209 , made a student eligible for a f - 1 student visa			0
in exchange for that form , students paid $ 1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months , authorities said			1
during their investigation , authorities interviewed 35 students , mainly from @entity16 , and found none resided in @entity1 , officials said			1
an unannounced federal inspection of @entity165 's main site in 2011 found only one @entity167 class with three students , though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites , prosecutors said			1
on the same day , federal authorities also visited the @entity97 found only one religion with one student , though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students , prosecutors said			1
some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other @entity81 schools also participating in the federal @entity243 , prosecutors said			1
the conspiracy count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years			0
the immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison , and the money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years , authorities said			0
wednesday 's arrests follow last week 's federal raids of more than three dozen " maternity hotels " in @entity4 where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a @entity81 - citizen baby , authorities said			2
the " maternity tourism " sites included apartment complexes in @entity1 , @entity261 and @entity263 counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said			2
those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from @entity7 , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by @entity105			1
those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said			0
specifically , authorities in the maternity tourism raids obtained search warrants for 37 location and conducted searches at more than 50 locations , including sites that consented to a federal search , said @entity283 , a spokeswoman for @entity105 .			2
