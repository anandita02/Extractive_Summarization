@entity3 @entity1 did not spy on closed - door talks over @entity6 's nuclear program involving the @entity7 and other world powers , an @entity1 official said tuesday , denying a @entity10 report			1
the newspaper reported late monday on its website that @entity1 had obtained confidential information about the negotiations to help it argue against a potential deal			1
" these allegations are utterly false , " the senior official in the @entity1 prime minister 's office told @entity2			1
" the state of @entity1 does not conduct espionage against the @entity7 or @entity1 's other allies			2
" the @entity1 government 's use of the information it allegedly gleaned -- sharing it with @entity7 lawmakers and others to undercut support for a deal -- was what really angered the @entity31 , the @entity10 reported monday , citing current and former @entity7 officials			1
" it is one thing for the @entity7 and @entity1 to spy on each other			2
it is another thing for @entity1 to steal @entity7 secrets and play them back to @entity7 legislators to undermine @entity7 diplomacy , " a senior @entity7 official briefed on the matter said , according to the newspaper			1
the @entity1 espionage efforts included eavesdropping and also acquiring information from confidential @entity7 briefings , informants and diplomatic contacts in @entity50 , the report says			1
the senior @entity1 official told @entity2 that " the false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the @entity7 and @entity1 and the security and intelligence relationship we share			1
" that 's not to say @entity1 officials have n't been asking around about the @entity6 nuclear talks , as participating parties race to get a framework agreement ahead of a march 31 deadline			2
intelligence minister @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity68 's national security adviser , led an @entity1 delegation that met early this week with a negotiating team from @entity71 , @entity1 @entity65 spokesman @entity64 said			1
the same @entity1 officials left @entity71 on tuesday morning for the @entity73 to meet with @entity73 's delegation on the @entity6 nuclear talks , according to @entity64			1
both @entity71 and @entity73 are among the @entity76 powers in the @entity77 , a group that also includes the @entity7 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , whose representatives have been across the table from @entity6			0
while in @entity85 , the @entity1 delegation did not meet with @entity71 foreign minister @entity86 , said @entity88 spokesman @entity87			1
the @entity1 officials ' apparent aim in @entity71 was not to " influence @entity85 ' position in the negotiations , but to further develop the debate on the @entity6 nuclear talks , " according to @entity87			1
@entity68 himself has been clear on where he stands on this debate : he told the @entity96 earlier this month that a proposed agreement , as he depicted it , was " a bad deal			0
" the @entity1 leader predicted that not only would such a deal not stop @entity6 from getting nuclear weapons , it would " all but guarantee that @entity6 gets ( nuclear ) weapons , lots of them			2
" " this deal wo n't be a farewell to arms ; it would be a farewell to arms control , " @entity68 said			0
" and the @entity109 would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires			0
" @entity6 officials have said they want a nuclear program for peaceful energy purposes			0
and they also want an end to the crippling sanctions which the @entity7 and others have instituted to pressure @entity117			0
@entity7 officials have long insisted their goal is to make sure that @entity6 does n't develop nuclear weapons			0
but @entity7 president @entity122 's administration also has been open to talks -- and felt undermined by some moves by @entity68 , who appears poised to remain @entity1 's prime minister after an election last week			2
in particular , @entity68 's speech to @entity96 stoked long simmering tensions with @entity122 , not least because it was organized by @entity31 speaker @entity130 without the @entity31 's prior knowledge			0
some questioned where @entity68 got his information on a proposed nuclear deal , particularly at a point when negotiations were in flux with no agreement in place			0
according to the @entity10 report , the sharing of sensitive information about the talks took place before @entity68 's address			2
it describes efforts by @entity1 ambassador @entity149 to lobby @entity7 lawmakers before an interim agreement with @entity6 in november 2013 and briefings by @entity153 and other @entity1 officials in the early months of this year			0
but a spokesman for the @entity1 embassy in @entity157 , @entity158 , told the @entity10 that " ambassador @entity153 never shared confidential intelligence information with members of @entity96			1
" @entity2 's @entity161 reported from @entity3 , and @entity162 reported and wrote from @entity163			0
@entity2 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 intelligence minister met with @entity71 delegation , his spokesman says
@entity10 : @entity1 used information it obtained to try to undercut support for a deal
" these allegations are utterly false , " an @entity1 official says of the spying claim
