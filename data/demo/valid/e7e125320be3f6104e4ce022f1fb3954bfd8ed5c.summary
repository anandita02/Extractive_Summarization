in the past eight months , @entity0 has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe			1
indicative of this was the announcement on saturday that the @entity8 terrorist group @entity7 had pledged its " allegiance to the @entity10 of the @entity11 , " @entity0 leader @entity12			1
the global spread of @entity0 raises key questions about whether these new affiliates signal an intensification of the threat of terror			1
it also has important implications for the debate in @entity23 over @entity25 's request for a new authorization to fight @entity0			1
lt. col. @entity27 , a @entity29 @entity28 reserve officer who has just returned to the @entity29 after advising the @entity8 @entity30 in its fight against @entity7 , told me , " so far the pledge ( to @entity0 ) seems to be legit			1
" waltz says there is some debate about the timing of the pledge , because @entity7 has recently come under effective attacks by @entity8 forces allied with the armies of neighboring @entity43 countries that are also threatened by the group : " some folks in the region are saying it 's a sign of desperation , as the regional offensive by @entity8 and its neighbors has knocked @entity7 on its heels and out of a number of its sanctuaries			1
the @entity55 have been particularly effective			0
" but @entity34 also says there is some evidence that the @entity7 pledge to @entity0 " has been in the works for some time			1
" the group 's increasing alignment with @entity0 is demonstrated by @entity7 's recent beheadings of its victims and its more professionally edited video releases of recent weeks that have mimicked @entity0 ' slick videos			2
@entity66 , whose book " @entity7 : @entity8 's @entity77 , " will be published next month , agrees that the more sophisticated @entity7 media releases of the past couple of months point to " some sort of inspiration " that @entity7 is drawing from @entity0 and that recent beheadings " might also be a form of copycat but , i shall note , they are not completely new " for @entity7			2
@entity78 also emphasized to me , " lately the government had been able to take back a number of towns under @entity7 control			0
@entity7 has always been very resilient and adaptable , changing and upping its game when needed			0
the pledge might be exactly that : @entity7 has recently suffered some serious blows and feels it needs to try something different to strengthen its position			2
" some 5,000 have died in @entity7 - related violence during the past half - decade , while more than 1.5 million have been forced out of their homes , but @entity7 has generally not attacked @entity93 targets			0
its affiliation with @entity0 could change that although , for the moment , it 's not clear how the @entity7 - @entity0 alliance would work from an operational standpoint			2
@entity100 , a researcher at the @entity101 at the @entity102 , told me , " @entity7 would be the largest group to pledge allegiance to @entity0 , but it 's not certain what kinds of logistical or operational support that @entity0 could provide an @entity43 affiliate			1
" since august , @entity7 is one of some 30 terrorist groups that have issued statements of support for @entity0 or have gone further and pledged their allegiance to @entity0 , according to @entity113 , a @entity114 - based company that tracks terrorist organizations			1
of most concern are the groups that have pledged allegiance to @entity0 , since this allows @entity0 some measure of command and control over these organizations and also means that these groups will likely more closely align with @entity0 ' goal of creating a caliphate across the @entity11 world as soon as feasible and use the most reprehensible of tactics to do so			2
in addition to @entity7 , terrorist groups in @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , the @entity136 and @entity137 have pledged allegiance to @entity0 , according to @entity113			1
what could this mean for the wider jihadist terrorist movement ? it 's worth taking a closer look at how the @entity132 branch of @entity0 , which affiliated with it in november , has played out on the ground in @entity132			2
a senior @entity29 government official told me that there is some debate in the @entity29 intelligence community about whether @entity0 ' @entity132 affiliate is more of a " wannabe " @entity0 , and a " rebranding " of a local group that wanted to take advantage of @entity0 ' fearsome brand , than a group that takes orders from @entity0 central command in @entity159 and @entity160			0
on january 27 , @entity0 gunmen attacked the @entity162 in the @entity132 capital , @entity164 , killing 10			0
five of the victims were foreigners and one was an @entity29			0
and last month @entity0 released a video showing members of @entity130 's @entity172 minority being beheaded on a @entity132 beach , apparently by members of @entity0 ' @entity132 affiliate			0
the video showed the victims in the orange jumpsuits that @entity0 forces its victims to wear			0
both the attack on the @entity162 and the beheading of the @entity180 do suggest some measure of command and control by @entity0 ' core of its @entity132 affiliate , according to the @entity29 government official , who says @entity132 fighters frequently go back and forth between @entity132 and @entity159 and @entity160			0
the increasing globalization of @entity0 raises some interesting questions for the @entity25 administration and for @entity23			1
last month @entity25 put forward a proposal for a new authorization for the @entity193 specifically targeting @entity0			2
@entity25 's @entity195 proposal mentions combating @entity0 in its heartland of @entity159 and @entity160 , but it does n't mention the dozen other countries where @entity0 now has a presence or foothold			1
interventionist @entity200 will likely want to see an @entity195 that specifically targets other groups allied to @entity0 that are outside of @entity159 and @entity160			0
many @entity203 will be uncomfortable about such an expansion			0
the ball is now in @entity23 ' court to decide how geographically wide the scope of the fight against @entity0 should be			1
it will be an interesting debate : on one side , those who want to prolong indefinitely what is already @entity29 's longest war , against jihadist terrorist groups like @entity0 that have affiliates from @entity129 to @entity128 ; and , on the other , those who want to circumscribe that war both in time and in space			1
given the fact that a broadly written @entity195 that was passed in the days after 9/11 has allowed the @entity29 to conduct military operations in half a dozen @entity11 countries over the course of the past 14 years , a new authorization that specifies both a sunset provision and also a specific geographic scope would be a useful check on executive power			0
and such an authorization could be amended if a substantial new threat from an @entity0 affiliate emerges .			0

@entity233 : @entity7 is the latest of terrorist groups in 12 countries to pledge allegiance to @entity0
he says the spread of @entity0 poses questions for @entity25 , @entity23 in deciding future of fight against terrorism
