@entity0 updates on @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , an economic twist on the old adage " all politics is local , " and an overseas vote where president @entity9 would love to see an anti-incumbent backlash -- those stories filled our sunday trip around the " @entity15 " table			1
the official @entity17 line will be something like this : the @entity22 people are making their choice , the @entity20 admires their vibrant democracy and looks forward to a close friendship and strategic partnership with the next @entity22 government no matter who wins			0
but it 's no secret president @entity9 is no fan of @entity31 , and the @entity22 prime minister 's recent address to a joint meeting of the @entity35 exposed the rawness of the relationship			0
so as the votes are counted and the coalitions debated in the week ahead , the @entity17 has both a personal and professional interest			0
@entity42 's @entity41 took a firsthand look at the @entity22 campaign in the final days and offered his take on the uncertainty			0
" now , @entity22 's political system is so complicated that even if ( @entity31 's ) party ends up not being the leading party , there are scenarios where he could end up in a governing coalition , " said @entity41			0
" but it 's interesting to note that @entity54 , the @entity55 leader , who 's his biggest challenger , wants to change @entity22 's approach to the world -- has been talking about trying to end @entity22 's isolation in the world , which would suggest changing a lot of policies that have infuriated this @entity17 or frustrated this @entity17 over the last several years			0
" @entity63 gov. @entity2 and former @entity65 gov. @entity64 tend to be at the top of @entity68 presidential polls these days , and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry			1
but @entity71 of the @entity72 took us inside some recent big - money conversations during which @entity2 took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival			1
@entity2 was in @entity77 last week for fund - raising meet and greets , and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him			1
@entity81 owner @entity80 was also on hand			0
" he was asked how he would beat @entity64 , and he surprised a bunch of people by saying @entity64 is the front - runner , " said @entity71			1
" now , that 's contrary to a lot of other things he said publicly last week			0
" " but that is his sell to people who could give him money , which is : ' no , no , ( @entity64 ) is the front - runner but i 'm the slow and steady guy who 's going to come up behind , just like when i ran track when i was younger			1
' " sen. @entity3 of @entity65 at times appears to be the odd man out in the early @entity68 presidential rankings			1
@entity64 's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for @entity3 to tap @entity65 's deep fund - raising well			1
then came the @entity2 boomlet , and talk among some conservatives that the @entity63 governor -- not @entity3 -- might be the best pick for a new generation @entity68 standard - bearer			1
but @entity3 has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar , and @entity118 of the @entity119 shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party 's 2012 nominee , @entity123			1
" he 's spoken with @entity123 twice since @entity123 decided not to get in the race , " said @entity118			1
" and he has had meetings this week with people like @entity128 , @entity123 's former policy director , and texts often with @entity129 , @entity123 's former finance director			1
" " i think @entity3 , if he nurtures those relationships , we 'll see him continue to rise in the donor community and with consultants and voters			2
" @entity135 gov. @entity4 is about to make his first @entity137 foray of the 2016 cycle and is getting some encouragement from important players in the first - in - the - nation primary state			1
@entity4 , who is exploring running but has n't been as aggressive as many other @entity143 in terms of travel and staff recruitment , will be in @entity137 on march 24 for the @entity147 and @entity149 breakfast , a rite of presidential passage sponsored by the @entity137 @entity152			2
word from people familiar with the trip is that @entity4 is being encouraged to be more active in @entity137 by former gov. @entity156 and his son , former @entity68 sen. @entity157			2
two @entity137 @entity68 activists also report that former @entity68 sen. @entity159 also believes @entity4 -- like @entity159 , a budget hawk during his time in @entity35 -- would be a strong addition to the @entity68 field			2
there is a crowded field of republicans testing the waters for 2016 -- and the people of @entity169 , @entity137 and @entity170 are grateful			0
they do n't have as much reason to be grateful to the @entity172 , who so far seem to be fixated on a single candidate			0
the lack of a big field will likely spare @entity177 a damaging mess , as @entity180 gov. @entity179 suggested last week			2
but , party loyalties aside , perhaps he would have a different take if his state were near the top of the nominating calendar			0
@entity186 of @entity187 reminded us the early presidential attention is an economic engine in those early states			0
" when you have robust primaries in both parties , you have tons of money flooding into @entity169 and @entity137 , @entity170 , on television ads , on hotels , transportation , campaign headquarters , " said @entity186			2
" and there is some concern that on the @entity172 side , we 're just simply not going to see that this time around			0
" " and it 's a reminder that politics has become such a big business beyond just the campaigns and the super pacs			0
