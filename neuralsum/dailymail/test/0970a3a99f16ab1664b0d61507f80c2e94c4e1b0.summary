they have a reputation as rather brutish creatures who chomped their way through huge hunks of meat , but it seems @entity7 may actually have been the first masterchefs			1
new research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food			1
scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old @entity7 teeth found in @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity7 ( represented in the drawing above ) may have been the world 's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet , according to a new scientific paper at first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self - medication , but now new findings have presented a different theory			1
dr @entity37 , a lecturer at the @entity39 in @entity40 , and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable			0
neanderthals may have cooked stews in the skins of animals , according to some anthropologists			0
animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by @entity7 are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks			2
this suggests that fat and meat had instead been cooked off the bones			0
a study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised @entity7 remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley			1
however , there is no evidence that @entity7 had any pots or pans to cook with			2
instead professor @entity66 , an archaeologist at the @entity67 , believes that they used animal paunches and folded bark to make bags that they could boil their good in			0
a study of plaque found on @entity7 teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley they have found that wild chimpanzees in @entity80 eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught			1
they say @entity7 could also used herbs to improve their culinary creations in the same way			1
there is already evidence that they cooked their food and may even have created stews in the skins of animals			0
writing in the journal @entity99 , dr @entity37 and her colleagues said : ' data on @entity7 behaviour suggest that their subsistence and technological strategies were complex			1
' neanderthals have long been portrayed as a rather primitive form of human that died out as they were unable to compete with the more sophisticated modern humans that arrived in @entity110 and @entity111 from @entity112			0
however , recent discoveries have shown that they may actually have had a complex culture - capable of making stone tools and even jewellery			1
three years ago researchers at the @entity118 examined ten teeth from the remains of five @entity7 found in @entity20 , northern @entity21			1
in the dental plaque of one young adult they discovered three compounds that occur naturally in yarrow and camomile			2
dr @entity126 and her team , who conducted that work , suggested that these plants had been used to help ward off illness or treat a diease			0
@entity132 for example has been used in the past to treat fever and to stem bleeding			0
however it was also a popular vegetable in the 17th century , while the leaves can also be dried and used as a herb			0
it is said to produce a pungent odour while having a slightly sweet and peppery taste that has been described as similar to spinach			0
@entity145 was also a popular treatment for inflammation , hayfever and stomach problems , but is still used to today to flavour foods in top restaurants			0
neither of the plants have much nutritional value but both convey strong flavours			0
dr @entity37 and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at @entity161 and @entity162 ate plants while chewing meat			1
new archaeological discoveries are expanding our knowledge of how @entity7 lived in ways that could not have been imagined when their fossilised remains , like the skeleton above , were first found by archaeologists celebrity chef @entity173 has become well known for his subtle use of flavours that contrasts with his rather brutish approach in the kitchen , but it seems he could also have learned some tips from @entity7 neanderthals , like the one shown above , may well have been the world 's first gourmet chefs , findings suggest they reason that if this was for medicinal purposes , different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments			1
however , the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat , suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead			1
dr @entity37 said that previous work has dismissed the idea that @entity7 were eating herbs to flavour food based on the assumption that their tastes were very basic			1
however , she says that if chimpanzees use plants to flavour their food , then it is entirely possible that @entity7 also used herbs and spices			1
writing in @entity99 , the researchers said : ' the strong , bitter taste of the leaves may modify the flavour of the viscera , muscles , organs or water			2
' in a @entity219 cookbook , a recipe proposes cooking a blanquette of veal with camomile			0
' the bitter taste of the cooked plant does not necessarily disappear completely ; camomile , for example , remains bitter when infused			2
' the presence of cooked carbohydrates , esters , phenols , pyrene and florathene in calculus samples from @entity20 supports the hypothesis that @entity7 were cooking plant food and perhaps smoking food , confirming that they were able to practice different food - processing techniques			2
' it is suggested that , among other cooking methods , roasting , heating or even potentially boiling to make soup , stew or stock might have been used by @entity7			0
' such a variety of practices , combined with the fact that the samples from @entity248 ´ on reveal the presence of smoke - related compounds , show that @entity7 were using food processing at least as complex as flavouring food with plant material			2
' other recent discoveries are starting to reveal what culinary creatures the @entity7 were			1
camomile is well known as a herb that can produce some interesting flavours for dishes and was eaten by @entity7 according to recent research on dental plaque that had hardened onto fossiled teeth @entity132 is a hardy plant but its leaves can be used as a herb known for its sweet flavour and bitter aftertaste @entity270 presented at the @entity271 this week suggests they tended to eat horses , deer and bovids rather than larger game like mammoths			1
according to @entity277 , @entity278 , from the @entity279 in @entity280 , said they also seemed to have sucked out the fatty marrow from bones			0
there is also some evidence from @entity7 sites in @entity287 that suggests they also liked nuts and wild olives			1
analysis of fossilised @entity7 faeces has also revealed that while they ate meat , they also had a ' significant intake of plants '			1
dr @entity296 , an anthropologist at @entity297 , said : ' this paper reminds us that the @entity7 were complicated and sophisticated humans			0
' while the data from dental calculus might be evidence for medicinal plants this new research highlights a number of alternative explanations ; the most intriguing of which is the use of food flavourings			0
' the comparison with chimps must be used carefully as they are a very different animal but the complex array of behaviours seen in world chimps gives us even more to marvel at when we think about what the @entity7 were capable of			2
' neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago , spreading to inhabit much of @entity110 and parts of @entity111 , but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago			1
the reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated homo sapiens			0
they were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age @entity110			0
however , a series of discoveries are now putting @entity7 into a new light			2
stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination			0
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in @entity219 also suggests @entity7 understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the @entity344 in @entity40 suggests that @entity7 may have built homes using the materials they found around them			1
they discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones			1
many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments			0
cross-hatched engravings found inside @entity353 in @entity287 are also thought to be the first known examples of @entity7 rock art. dna analysis has also shown that @entity7 carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak			2
eight talons found at a 130,000 year old @entity7 site in @entity361 in @entity362 are also thought to be the world 's first jewellery , and may have been worn as a necklace			2
the traditional image of @entity7 as primitive creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence			0

scientists suggest that *prehistoric* human *cousins* used herbs like yarrow and camomile to improve the taste of their food around 50,000 years ago
chimps in @entity80 also eat plants with their meat in a way that is thought to flavour their food so researchers believe @entity7 also did the same
it build recent discoveries that suggest they also ate barley , olives and nuts
the findings *transform* the view of @entity7 as *unsophisticated* brutes
