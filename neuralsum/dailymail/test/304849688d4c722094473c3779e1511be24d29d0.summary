it 's official : alcohol makes you more attractive to the opposite sex			1
and that 's when you are boozing , not them			2
scientists at the @entity7 found that having ' one large glass of wine ' increases ' facial flushing ' and ' confidence ' , making the drinker ' more attractive ' to others and more likely to ' get lucky '			1
researchers quizzed 40 heterosexual male and female students and asked them to rate the attractiveness of three groups of people who were sober , tipsy and drunk			0
a study of 40 men and women found drinking a glass of wine makes you more attractive to the opposite sex ... ... but too much booze leads to ' excessive and unattractive ' changes in facial expressions , like @entity30 the study found that tipsy people , who had downed one large 250ml glass of 14 per cent wine - that 's one - third of the bottle - were consistently voted as the ' most attractive '			1
sober subjects and those who had ' had a few too many ' were rated as far less attractive than a ' tipsy ' subject			2
academics have previously confirmed the existence of the ' beer goggles ' phenomenon - in which boozers find other people more attractive after several drinks			1
this new study , however , is the first time it had been shown that the drinker themselves actually ' becomes more attractive ' to others , in an experiment dubbed ' reverse beer goggles '			1
the study found that alcohol had a ' positive pulling power ' , but only if the subject was ' not hammered '			2
it states that booze ' mimics ' how a person 's body ' demonstrates it is healthy and attractive to attract potential mates ' and that facial flushing is perceived by others as ' healthy and attractive '			1
alcohol also makes people seem in a ' more positive or jolly mood ' and encourages people to ' relax ' and give off ' positive ' signals , such as smiling - increasing their attractiveness levels			0
the study states : ' in addition to perceiving others as more attractive , an alcohol consumer may also be perceived by others as more attractive , and therefore receive greater sexual interest from potential mates			1
' an increase in such attention from others may also positively reinforce alcohol consumption , particularly in social contexts			0
' the study found alcohol has ' positive pulling power ' but only if the person is n't too intoxicated the study said , however , that too much booze led to ' changes in facial expressions which were excessive and unattractive ' - leading to a decrease in ' pulling power '			1
it adds : ' in conclusion , our data indicate that alcohol consumption may lead to consumers being rated as more attractive than sober individuals , but only following low levels of consumption			2
' at higher levels of consumption this effect is not observed , and may even be reversed			0
' professor @entity105 , a senior researcher on the @entity7 study , said : ' the people who had consumed a small amount of alcohol had a slightly rosier complexion than they did in their sober and high - dose photos			1
' @entity113 is attractive because it characterises good physical health characteristics			2
' you consume a drink , so you see other people as more attractive , but you also become more attractive yourself because you 've consumed a drink			0
' but if they go on to consume more alcohol , they 're no longer rated as more attractive			0
' in a previous study last year , again at the @entity7 , it was found that ' beer goggles ' - in which booze makes others seems more attractive - was a proven phenomena			1
volunteers drank either alcohol or a non-alcoholic placebo before looking at images of men 's and women 's faces - as well a landscape portraits			0
those who drank alcohol found all three image types more attractive compared with those who did not			0
@entity142 , 31 , of @entity143 , @entity144 , said last week : ' so if i want to pull i need to drink either a third of a bottle of wine or a couple of pints and then draw a line under boozing for the night			0
' i ca n't really see that happened as after a couple you always want more , but if it improves my chances of pulling i 'll give it a shot			0
