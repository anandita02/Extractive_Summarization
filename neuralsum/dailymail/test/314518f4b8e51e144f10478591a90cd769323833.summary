by the time he reached 17 , there was no room for @entity3 at home			1
his mother started compulsively hoarding when he was a young boy , refusing to trash anything ; unable to fix anything			1
in his senior year , 1995 , it was too much : he moved out			0
now , two decades later , he and his younger sister @entity10 have returned to the family home in @entity12 , @entity13 - and nothing has changed			1
@entity3 , 37 , had visited his mother but only stood outside before picking her up to spend time elsewhere			1
@entity10 , also 37 , returned just twice , on the advice of her counselor , to confront the deeply - embedded shame she felt			1
but when their mother passed away following a 12 - year battle with breast cancer in 2013 , the house was handed to them			1
finally returning to the meticulous havoc , they were inspired to create a moving photo - series with their own children to document the reality of being a hoarder 's child			1
he did this by superimposing shots of his son onto images of the trash - ridden home in @entity12 ' no place for a child ' : his younger sister @entity10 , also aged 37 , joined him as they confronted their past after their mother died of breast cancer in 2013			1
@entity10 's four - year - old daughter is superimposed onto a shot of the bathroom which has not been touched since they left in 1993 @entity3 , a photographer , wanted to picture his son and @entity10 's daughter going about their daily lives among the trash - as they had done years before			1
but the crumbling house is so unsafe , and their feelings still so raw , that they opted to use @entity66 and superimpose the children onto the images			1
regardless , the highly realistic results strike an uneasy feeling that @entity3 says was so difficult to come to terms with			1
' it is difficult to describe the feeling of shame , the fear of embarrassment that you have growing up with a hoarder , ' @entity3 , who is still based nearby in @entity12 , tells @entity79			1
' people would say " why did n't you just throw things away ? " it 's just not as simple as that			2
hoarders have a deep - rooted sense of attachment to things and it seems crazy but they have a sense of order			1
' my sister and i would try to throw things away , but if anything even moved our mom would get very upset			2
' going back was an emotional experience			0
' when we were kids , i would only ever open the door by a crack when people came by			0
we never had people over			0
' it 's a complex issue ' : @entity3 said people have since asked him why they did n't just throw things away			1
he said the issue was deeper than that and his mother had a deep - rooted attachment to every little piece of the havoc			1
but as a child it was difficult to understand ' sense of perspective ' : @entity10 said the pictures have helped her to see that the home she felt so uncomfortable in was no place for children @entity10 's bedroom : @entity10 made clear that she did not want the children to enter the crumbling house , which is filled with mold , as it is unsafe and also occupies a difficult emotional space for her			1
she wants her daughter to know that she would never put her in that situation breaking point : @entity3 moved out when he was 17 in 1995 when a pipe burst during the winter			2
' there was no heating and i had to be responsible			0
it was the hardest thing i had had to do in my life up until that point and i could n't take it any more , ' he said ' things would break and never be fixed			1
we did n't have a working refrigerator - we would leave food on the back porch in the winter , and get a cooler in the summer , but that would break too			1
' i had to leave in january of my senior year because the pipes broke			0
it was so cold , there was no heating , and i was just 17			0
it was the hardest thing i 'd had to do in my life up until that point ; to be the adult , be responsible			0
it was too much for me , so i left			2
' @entity10 was already long - gone by that point			1
just 19 months younger than @entity3 , she left when she was 15 in 1993 , to live with their father in the same village			1
she did n't return until she finished college in 2001			2
' i was going through counseling , and discovered that the house was a big part of the issues i was dealing with , ' @entity10 , based in @entity159 , told @entity79			2
' my counselor said i should go back , and take friends to confront the feeling of embarrassment			0
it was that feeling that people did n't know about that side of our lives			2
we never let anyone in , and then we left it behind			0
feeling of shame : in this image ( left ) @entity3 is recreating the way he would hide behind the door when people came to visit , and never let people come to visit			1
@entity10 returned to the house when she finished college on the advice of her counselor to confront the feeling of shame unmoved : they photographed the scene completely untouched when they returned to clean it up after their mother passed away the moment they returned together was important for them , they said			1
they both knew what each other had gone through as kids ' the first time i stepped in there , the memories washed over me			0
my mom was n't there , but she had given me permission to go			0
' my two friends came in after me , they were supportive and gracious , but i could tell they were also taken aback by it all			0
' a few years later , she returned again with the man that would become her husband			0
and finally , in 2013 , she and @entity3 returned together			2
' it was a really important moment for both of us i think , ' she told @entity79			0
' to be there with someone who knew what you had gone through			0
we could talk about memories , and now that we 're both parents we could reflect on how it affected us			0
placing their children in the frames was a cathartic experience that , @entity10 says , helped her fully understand how she had been affected			2
' seeing my own daughter sat there in my room , even though she was n't actually there , was a really big thing for me			0
' you see it from an outside perspective : this is no place for a child			0
' i do n't think we really knew at the time			0
for children , it is an enormous , complex , emotional concept to get your head around			0
' the pair made clear that they continued to have a relationship with their mother until the day she died			2
it was the house , however , that left them with such difficult feelings			2
' my mom worked hard , she had multiple jobs and children			0
i do n't blame her for that , ' @entity3 says			2
' but it was difficult for us			0

@entity3 and @entity10 both grew up with a mother who compulsively hoarded things
refrigerator did n't work , trash piled up , but nothing was fixed . it left them with deep - rooted feelings of shame
two decades after they left , their mother died and the house was passed to them
they have *revisited* and created a photo series , superimposing their children onto photos of the house to show the uneasy sight of youngsters growing up in that *environment*
