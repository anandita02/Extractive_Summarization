@entity0 has warned @entity1 that life after @entity3 may not be all he hopes it to be after the @entity6 youngster revealed this week that he had rejected a £ 100,000 - a - week deal at @entity8			1
@entity0 , like @entity1 , started his senior career at @entity3 but eventually moved on to @entity10 in 2004			1
but he says the 20 - year - old is not good enough to make the same move to the @entity14 capital			0
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are all said to be interested in the hottest property in @entity20 football , but @entity3 are determined not to let one of their star players leave , even with his contract expiring at the end of next season			2
@entity0 has warned @entity1 that leaving @entity3 may not be all he hopes it would be @entity0 , like @entity1 , started his senior career at @entity3 but eventually moved on to @entity10 @entity0 feels that @entity1 is in a great place to develop , having done the same during his time at @entity8 @entity0 feels that @entity1 is in a great place to develop , but argues that it does n't mean the youngster owes the club anything			1
' there is no question he ( @entity1 ) has been at the perfect place to learn his trade and he has been managed fantastically well so far , ' @entity0 said			2
' but that should n't mean he should be indebted to the extent of feeling he owes everything to the club			0
if the club created top players from nothing then everyone would make it			0
' a club is quick to get rid of a player when they do n't serve a purpose anymore so why should a player not do what 's best for him when the boot is on the other foot ? ' @entity0 scored 158 goals during his time at @entity3 , spending eight seasons on @entity57 until 2004 @entity0 bursts away from @entity58 of @entity59 before he left @entity3 for @entity10 @entity0 left @entity3 for @entity10 in a £ 16.8million move in 2004 before later moving on to @entity61 @entity1 is expected to start for @entity3 in saturday 's lunchtime kick - off against @entity16 after @entity63 stated his intention to keep hold of the winger			1
and @entity0 says that the lack of a place in @entity10 or @entity70 's teams mean that the only move he could make away from @entity8 would be a sideways one			1

but he is still a notch or two off being " world class "			0
' i do n't see what realistic options he has got if a move away from @entity8 was on his mind			0
he would n't get into @entity10 's or @entity70 's teams and any other move surely has to be seen as a move sidewards ? '			0

@entity1 has *stalled* over signing a new contract with @entity3
