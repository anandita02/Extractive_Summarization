the first high - resolution footage of solar flux ropes on the sun has been revealed			1
in the fascinating video , twisting groups of magnetic fields can be seen writhing around			1
and with the new images it may be possible to further understand their evolution and how they cause space weather			0
research led by a scientist at the @entity13 has revealed the first high - resolution footage of a solar flux ' rope ' taking shape on the sun , shown in this still image the new footage was revealed in a paper in @entity22 led by dr @entity23 from the @entity13			1
a solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage , which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun. they are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface across hundreds of kilometres			1
as common structures in the solar corona , they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather - including solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity40 )			2
the formation of a flux rope can take weeks , but the moment when it is flung into the atmosphere can take just a matter of hours			1
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity59 's magnetic field			0
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
in the video , twisting groups of magnetic fields writhe around a central axis , and the rope ultimately causes a bright flash - a solar flare - to form , shown here dr @entity23 and his colleagues made the findings using the 5.2ft ( 1.6 metres ) @entity83 at the @entity84 in @entity85			1
they describe an s - shaped bundle of magnetic fields , from which a set of loops peel off and grow upward into a multi-stranded flux rope in just two minutes			1
two flare ribbons also appear at the point where the rope joins the solar atmosphere			2
it is hoped the study , which shows a flux rope in unprecedented detail , could help increase understanding on how they form - and how they are related to solar eruptions			1
‘ in the large scale , magnetic flux ropes are found in the interplanetary magnetic clouds , which may interact with @entity59 ’s magnetic field to generate geomagnetic storms , ’ the researchers wrote in their paper			2
solar flux ropes are common structures in the solar corona , and they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather – including solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity40 ) , pictured			2

@entity13 research reveals *stunning* video
it shows a solar flux ' rope ' taking shape on the sun
twisting groups of magnetic fields writhe around a central axis
and the rope ultimately causes a bright flash - a solar flare - to form
