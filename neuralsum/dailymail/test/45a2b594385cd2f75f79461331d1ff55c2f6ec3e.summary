sitting in a restaurant with friends , @entity0 pushed food longingly around her plate , desperate to eat but unable to stand the pain it would cause			1
her mouth felt as if it were on fire , her gums were beginning to blister and her teeth had grown so sensitive that she knew that if so much as a sip of water came into contact with them she would wince			2
but @entity0 ’s agony was tempered with pride , because when she did manage to summon a smile , it was the most dazzling at her table			1
@entity0 , 40 ( pictured ) , believes the discomfort involved with teeth whitening is worth it for the end result of a bright smile she had spent four hours earlier that afternoon bleaching her teeth and , as far as she was concerned , the considerable discomfort was worth it			1
‘ whitening has been unbearably painful at times , ’ says @entity0 , 40			1
‘ but i am obsessive about having a bright smile			1
’ @entity0 ’s regimen may sound somewhat masochistic , but she is one of an increasing number of women for whom whitening their teeth has become an integral part of their beauty routine — as normal as colouring their hair or waxing their legs			1
in @entity42 , sales of tooth whitening products have risen 300 per cent since 1996 , and the trend for excessive bleaching has grown so commonplace there that dentists have coined a new word for it — ‘ bleachorexia ’			1
symptoms include burning gums , tooth infection and the conviction that , no matter how much a tooth has been whitened , it could be paler still			2
perhaps predictably , it has caught on in @entity55			2
almost a third of @entity55 are now preoccupied with whitening their teeth , and research this week revealed the highest - earning cosmetic dentists made a collective turnover of £ 1 billion last year — a 22 per cent increase from 2010			1
‘ when it is done properly , tooth whitening is a simple and safe way of improving your appearance , ’ says cosmetic dentist dr @entity61			2
‘ but if it is performed in an unregulated fashion , with the wrong product , it can cause enamel erosion , receding gums and infection			2
’ @entity72 ( pictured ) is part of a growing group of women for whom teeth whitening has become an integral part of their beauty regime @entity0 , a banking finance officer from @entity79 , started whitening her teeth five years ago , influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired			1
‘ my own teeth looked grey in comparison after years of caffeinated drinks and they were affecting my confidence , ’ she says			1
the active ingredient in most professional whitening products is hydrogen peroxide , in gel form			2
in october 2012 , an @entity94 council directive made it illegal in @entity55 to use hydrogen peroxide — which can cause sensitivity and burning when applied too often or at too high a dose — in concentrations above 6 per cent , and decreed any concentration over 0.1 per cent could be administered only by a dental professional			1
when carrying out the procedure , a dentist makes a mould of the patient ’s teeth from which a special tray is constructed			2
hydrogen peroxide gel is then squirted on to the tray via a syringe , and the tray fitted over the teeth and left for 45 minutes			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) started whitening her teeth five years ago having been influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired usually , the first treatment is carried out at the surgery , then the patient is given syringes and the tray to use at home — 45 minutes a day , for a fortnight , being the norm			1
the treatment normally costs up to £ 500 , so when @entity0 spotted a diy whitening kit online for £ 17.99 , she was tempted			1
it looked authentic enough : a silicone tray and five syringes of bleach			1
@entity0 is n’t sure how strong this hydrogen peroxide was , or indeed even if it was hydrogen peroxide			1
but the tray had to be moulded to her teeth — by softening in boiling water first — then worn overnight			2
that ’s when the warning bells should have sounded , says dr @entity61 : ‘ trays should always be properly fitted by a dentist otherwise they will never fit well and can cause leakage , which irritates gums			2
’ @entity138 ( pictured ) has been bulk - buying high - strength bleach from @entity42 to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years sure enough , the minute @entity0 put the tray on , her gums started to tingle			1
‘ i just assumed it meant it was working , ’ she says			0
keen to go whiter than white , she kept the bleach on for an hour — another mistake , says dr @entity61			1
‘ after 45 minutes out of the syringe , hydrogen peroxide loses effectiveness			0
more time wo n’t make your teeth whiter , it will just lead to irritation and sensitivity			0
and if you have decay in your teeth , it can enter and lead to infection			0
’ but @entity0 was so delighted with the initial results that she used her whitening kit once a week , leaving it on for longer each time			1
by the time she had reached her last syringe , she was bleaching for up to four hours at a time			0
@entity138 ( pictured ) was just 19 when she first tried bleaching her teeth , she now says it 's addictive and she 'll carry on doing it for ever ‘ my teeth were so weak and sensitive i worried they were going to fall out			1
i knew i was being irrational , but having white teeth had become a part of my identity			0
it was only after an evening of not being able to eat and waiting for days for my swollen gums to go down that i realised i ’d gone too far			0
’ so @entity0 invested in whitening toothpastes , a whitening powder and a whitening pen instead			1
ironically , the changes made to the law in 2012 , which were supposed to protect patients ’ dental health , have seen a flood of illegal @entity120 whitening products on to the market , alongside unqualified practitioners who cater for those — like @entity0 — who ca n’t afford a dentist ’s whitening service			1
‘ there has been an upsurge in beauticians whitening teeth with unregulated materials , ’ says dr @entity61			0
‘ many use chlorine dioxide — a strong antibacterial chemical sometimes found in swimming pools — which is easier to get hold of , given the government ’s restrictions on hydrogen peroxide			0
@entity138 ( pictured ) buys £ 50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the @entity42 and insists she has no pain or side effects from the treatment ‘ at a high concentration , this can burn gums , leading to receding , and make tooth enamel rough and porous , which leaves it prone to further staining — trapping users into a vicious cycle of whitening			1
’ @entity212 , from @entity213 , is suffering from suspected enamel erosion after having her teeth whitened , for £ 30 , by a beautician operating illegally			0
she had seen an advert on @entity218			0
unknown to @entity212 , aged 17 , she is a year under the legal age limit for teeth whitening , but the beautician did n’t check			1
‘ she painted the whitening gel on with cotton wool , ’ remembers @entity212			0
‘ it did n’t feel professional or hygienic , but this was my first experience of tooth whitening			0
’ as soon as the beautician removed the gel an hour later , and @entity212 rinsed her mouth , her teeth felt agonisingly sensitive			0
newlywed @entity231 ( pictured ) is a recent convert to tooth bleaching but is already very taken with it ‘ the beautician said this was normal , ’ she recalls			2
‘ when the pain did n’t go away over the next few days i called her back , but she still said there was nothing to worry about			2
’ after later discovering that her beautician had been operating illegally , she reported her to the @entity241 — the regulatory body for @entity55 dentists			0
since then , @entity212 ’s teeth have grown more painful			0
‘ they ’re so sensitive that it hurts when they come into contact with fresh air , ’ she says			0
‘ i have to wear a scarf over my mouth outdoors			0
eating is agony and i drink through a straw			0
’ meanwhile , her teeth are starting to turn yellow because the dentine that is underneath the enamel is becoming exposed			0
‘ not only am i in pain , but , ironically , my teeth have never looked worse , ’ says @entity212			2
beauticians practising illegally are not the only problem , however			0
increasing numbers of women are ordering industrial - strength hydrogen - peroxide whitening products online from the @entity42 , where there are no legal limits on levels			1
@entity231 ( pictured ) and her husband , @entity268 , both started bleaching their teeth before they got married last october @entity138 , 33 , has been bulk - buying high - strength bleach from @entity42 to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years			1
she was 19 and working as a beauty therapist when she first tried it			0
she buys £ 50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the @entity42 , yet insists she has no side - effects other than sensitive teeth			1
‘ at work , having white teeth makes me look more professional , ’ she says			0
‘ and having so many pictures of ourselves plastered on social media makes it obvious who has whitened their teeth and who has n’t			0
‘ tooth whitening is addictive , and i ’ll carry on bleaching mine for ever			0
’ according to the @entity292 the effects of professional whitening can last for up to three years			2
although her husband stopped after their wedding , @entity231 ( pictured ) has carried on and says its part of her beauty routine now but newlywed @entity298 — a recent convert to tooth bleaching — is already hooked on doing it far more frequently than that			1
@entity231 and her husband @entity268 , 34 , started whitening their teeth last january in the run - up to their wedding last october			1
‘ we wanted to look our best in the pictures , ’ says @entity231 , 36 , a @entity306 manager from @entity307			0
they ordered £ 55 boxes of 20 whitening strips — fabrics impregnated with 6 per cent hydrogen peroxide gel that users stick to their teeth for 45 minutes — from the @entity317			0
‘ @entity268 stopped after our wedding and says i do n’t need to whiten my teeth any more either , ’ says @entity231			2
‘ but i ’ll carry on			0
it ’s as much a part of my beauty routine as having my hair coloured and legs waxed			0

@entity0 , 40 , believes the pain involved is worth it for a bright smile
@entity138 , 33 , has bought high - strength bleach from @entity42 for 13 years
@entity298 started before her wedding last year and is already a convert
