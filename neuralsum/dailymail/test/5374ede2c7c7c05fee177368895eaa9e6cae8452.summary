while we all know the key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding a middle ground between the amount of food you eat and the amount of exercise you put in , it can sometimes be a bit tricky to anticipate exactly how much exercise is required			1
with @entity13 just around the corner we thought it would be helpful to give you a real life gauge on how much cardio you 'll need to put in to get the most out of your @entity13 binge session			2
starting at the very bottom of the chocolate egg scale is the mini solid egg , around four of them equate to 550 kilojules			0
after eating only four mini solid chocolate eggs that contain 550 kilojules you 'll need to run for at least 40 minutes to melt the calories away a 67 - kilogram woman who ate only four of these snack sized treats would need to vigorously walk for around 40 minutes before the guilt , and the calories melted away			1
a man weighing in at around 80 kilograms could achieve the same in 30 minutes			0
any child , or grown adult for that matter , out on an @entity13 scavenger hunt is sure to come across a chocolate replica of the @entity38 himself			0
you would need to run for about half an hour to burn off a hollow chocolate egg what you ’ll be surprised to find is that a medium chocolate bunny contains around 4400 kilojules that wo n’t burn themselves off			2
if you chose the humble kayak as your weapon against weight gain , ladies you 'd be expected to paddle for at least three hours to burn that bunny off			0
gents you 've lucked out in this department and will only have to spend around two hours in the water			0
if cycling is more your style , then men you 'll need to spend just under two hours pedaling and ladies , you 'll need to put in just over that for that bunny to be history			2
if you wanted to munch on a small bunny there ’s no avoiding the 2212 kilojules that come with it			0
ladies , you could hop in the pool and swim for just over an hour , or guys just under an hour , before that bunny would have melted away			0
if you 've taken home a large chocolate bunny you can expect to spend at least three hours playing squash before you have worked off the 11060 kilojules added to your daily intake			1
for those who like their @entity13 with all the trimmings can expect to spend around three and a half hours on the squash court for women and just under three hours for men , before they ’ll be able to burn off a large bunny which adds around 11060 kilojules to your daily calorie intake			1
chocolate is n’t the only temptation around @entity13 time with two hot cross buns containing around 1800 kilojules , and that 's without any butter or jam ! fruit hot cross buns will have you hitting the pavement for an hour - and that 's if you forgo the generous layer of butter ! for those who can go without the extra spread you ’ll need to run for about 40 - 50 minutes to work them off			1
for those who ca n’t , expect another 30 minutes of cardio before the calories are gone ! if you thought classic hot cross buns were bad , wait until you ’re faced with 1030 kilojules of choc - chip hot cross bun - and that ’s just for one ! men will need to salute the sun for around an hour and fifteen minutes with ladies putting in an hour and a half of yoga before the singular bun will vanish ! hot cross bun 's calorie laden , choc chip counterpart will require around an hour and a half of yoga before it 's completely gone !			1

a *balanced* diet can get *harder* to achieve around the *holiday* times
to keep healthy it 's *important* to maintain *regular* exercise
to burn off four mini @entity13 eggs you 'll need to exercise for 40 minutes
a large @entity13 bunny would have you on the squash court for 3 hours
those who eat hot cross buns would spend an hour hitting the pavement
