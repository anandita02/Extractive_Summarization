pensioners are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105			1
@entity2 is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35 - year loan – stoking fears of a buy - to - let boom			1
the offer comes as pension reforms give over- 55s access to billions of pounds from today to withdraw from their pension pots and spend as they like			1
tens of thousands of savers are being tempted to put their money into property – and this surge of ‘ silver landlords ’ is likely to push up house prices			0
@entity2 is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35 - year loan , meaning some pensioners are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105 ( file picture , posed ) traditionally , banks have been reluctant to allow borrowing beyond retirement , but now other lenders are considering raising their age limits too			1
savers who want to put their money towards buy - to - let properties are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase a house outright , with the average price standing at £ 273,000			1
the option of taking out a mortgage to cover the shortfall has previously been unavailable as banks prefer people to repay before turning 70 or 75			2
but unlike residential mortgages , funded by income likely to fall away in retirement , a buy - to - let mortgage is funded by rental income , which does not cease when the owner retires			1
economists say the increase in silver landlords competing to buy properties is boosting house prices , which are increasing at 8.4 per cent a year			2
three in four of @entity55 ’s 2million landlords regard their property as their pension , according to research from financial consultancy @entity59			0
about one in five homes in @entity55 are owned by private landlords , and this is expected to rise to one in three by 2032 , @entity61 figures suggest			0
but there are perils too			0
the buy - to - let boom expected to follow today ’s changes could have painful tax consequences for some , experts warn			2
withdrawing large sums from a pension pot will trigger a hefty income tax bill – for example , taking out £ 150,000 will produce a £ 40,000 demand from @entity77			0
buy - to - let homes also attract tax on rental income and capital gains tax if the property is later sold			2
and for ageing landlords , there is inheritance tax to consider too			0
tens of thousands of savers who have had their pension released under today 's new reforms are being tempted to put their money into property – and this surge of ‘ silver landlords ’ is likely to push up house prices @entity96 of @entity97 said : ‘ although age @entity97 believes affordability not age should determine whether someone is given a loan , using your pension fund to pay the deposit could have significant tax and financial consequences and if there is a downturn in the rental market you could find your own financial security is jeopardised			1
’ @entity2 decided soon after the pension reforms were announced in 2014 that it would consider applicants aged up to 70 for a 35 - year loan			1
the firm said it had recognised that buy - to - let was becoming a more popular source of retirement income as reports suggest half a million savers could plough pension pots into buy - to - let properties after the reforms take effect today			1
experts have also warned of the difficulty of taking on a landlords ’ responsibilities			0
financial strategist @entity129 said : ‘ a lot of people will buy houses with their pension funds with no idea of the repercussions			1
‘ there may be excellent advantages but the downsides are that many of them will not appreciate that the management of a property can be harsh			0
when you are aged 104 , do you really want to be managing a property ? ‘ difficult tenants feigning problems with the property , periods when the property is empty , council tenants not paying – there is a long list			0
people should not go into it without good advice			0
’ if a person with a mortgage that lasts until they are 105 dies before paying off the loan , the usual rules apply : their estate , or whoever inherits the property , would either take on the debt or the house would be sold to pay off the mortgage			2
however , it is cheaper for young people to obtain life cover to pay off the mortgage if they die early .			0
