while @entity1 and @entity2 are developing self driving vehicles , @entity0 has revealed its vision - and its a lot more fun			1
called the @entity6 , or @entity7 , it was developed at @entity0 's @entity8 to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets			1
on @entity13 , however , it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot , as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph			1
watch the buggy in action below unlike a normal car , the buggy has no mechanical linkages to the propulsion , steering , or brake actuators , the driver of an @entity7 relies completely on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and then transmitted by wires to the vehicle 's motors			2
a turn of the steering wheel , for instance , is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle			1
these computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate , causing the vehicle to turn as commanded			1
@entity0 says the vehicles was buit ' in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on @entity13			1
' ' with seating for two people , @entity7 is a fully electric vehicle well - suited for busy urban environments , it says			0
@entity7 is driven by four independent wheel modules called e-corners			2
each e-corner consists of a redundant steering actuator , a passive trailing arm suspension , an in - wheel propulsion motor , and a motor - driven friction braking system			2
each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated ± 180 degrees about its axis			1
this allows for a suite of driving modes allowing @entity7 to maneuver unlike any traditional vehicle on the road			2
in addition to conventional front two wheel steering , the back wheels can also articulate allowing for turning radiuses as tight as zero			2
the driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni - directional , crab - like motion			1
this makes a maneuver such as parallel parking as easy as driving next to an available spot , stopping , and then operating sideways to slip directly in between two cars			1
' this two - seater vehicle was designed to meet the growing challenges and demands of urban transportation , ' said @entity87 , also with @entity8			1
' the @entity7 would be ideal for daily transportation in an urban environment with a designed top speed of 70 km / hr and range of 100 km of city driving on a single charge of the battery			2
' the size and maneuverability of @entity7 gives it an advantage in navigating and parking in tight quarters			0
' with a designed top speed of around 70 km / hr , test driving proved to be a bit of fun			0
@entity104 told an @entity0 magazine : ' it 's like driving on ice but having complete control			1
' it 's a blast to ride in and even more fun to drive			0
we 've talked about it being like an amusement park ride			0
' the ' fun ' of driving was not something we tried to design for , just something that came out of the design			0
' once we got it running many of us commented that we had no idea it was going to be able to do the things it does			0
' ' this work also allowed us to develop some technologies we felt were needed for our future rovers , ' said @entity104			0
the driver controls @entity7 with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator / brake pedal assembly			0
the driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction - perfect for parallel parking			2
' these include redundant by - wire systems , liquid cooling , motor technology , advanced vehicle control algorithms			0
' we were able to learn a lot about these and other technologies by building this vehicle			0
' the buggy can also be controlled remotely , and in the future @entity0 says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving			1
the driver controls @entity7 with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator / brake pedal assembly			0
both of these interfaces were specially designed to mimic the feel of the mechanical / hydraulic systems that people are used to feeling when driving their own cars			2
the buggy can also be controlled remotely , and in the future @entity0 says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving			1
' while the vehicle as a whole is designed around operating in an urban environment , the core technologies are advancements used in many of our robotic systems and rovers , ' said @entity87			0
' actuators , motor controllers , sensors , batteries , @entity172 , component cooling , sealing , and software are all examples of technologies that are being devel oped and tested in @entity7 that will be used in next generation rover systems			0
' the technologies developed in @entity7 have direct application in future manned vehicles undertaking missions on the surface of @entity13 's moon , on @entity185 , or even an asteroid			1
' additionally , @entity7 provides a platform to learn lessons that could drive the next generation of automobiles .			0

@entity6 developed at @entity0 's @entity8
each wheel can be controlled independently and turn 180 degrees
shows off the technologies that could let man move across other planets
could also be used to *improve* self driving cars on @entity13
