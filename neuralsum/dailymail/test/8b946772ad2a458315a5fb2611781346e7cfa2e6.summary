@entity0 is here ! and whilst many @entity2 are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats , many are wondering how much it 's going to cost them around the waistline			2
according to the @entity8 , the key is to maintain an even balance of ' energy in ' and ' energy out			2
' this means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight			0
a small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off indulging in two hot cross buns ( without jam and butter ) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off it may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of @entity0 treats			1
for four solid mini chocolate easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules			1
a female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes , whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes			1
one medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off			0
the key for @entity0 indulgence is noting our ' energy in ' and ' energy out ' and balancing food and fitness experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam , it would take 80 minutes of running			1
exercise physiologist @entity62 from @entity63 has said that many @entity2 still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume			0
' it 's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption , than to try and work off the energy after you 've taken it in , ' he said			1
@entity62 is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat			0
he advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then			0
' what we 're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices ; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time			0
that way when holidays , like @entity0 , come around they do n't have to feel like they have to deny themselves , ' he said .			2

the key for @entity0 indulgence is noting our ' energy in ' and ' energy out '
for four mini @entity0 eggs it would take 30 *-* 40 minutes of walking to work off
two hot cross buns without butter take up to 50 minutes of running
it is advised that we manage our energy consumption instead of working it off after it has been taken in
