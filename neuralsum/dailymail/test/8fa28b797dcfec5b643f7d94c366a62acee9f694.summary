there were 7 corpses on that day ... one of them was a child			0
' during the ceremony a monk will pray then the " sky burial master " will start cutting the corpses			0
when he is done , the condors will all fly to the corpses ' they believe the more the condors eat , the better it is and they will not eat bad people 's body			0

when the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist			0
she ended up taking him around the whole monastery , showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray			0
