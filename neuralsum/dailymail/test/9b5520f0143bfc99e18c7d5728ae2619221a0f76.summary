@entity1 opened up their kitchens to skeptics and fans alike on saturday and there were no mutant chickens to be seen , the deep fryer was as clean as a whistle and the salad was crisp			1
it was no - doubt enough to convince some critics of one of the world 's biggest fast food chains that it is n't all bad , but health experts still say that no matter how hygienic the conditions of the 612 @entity1 outlets in @entity18 are , the food they make just is n't good for you			1
the franchise allowed hundreds of people to take a look behind the scene of 219 stores and roam from freezer to fryer while watching staff continue their daily cooking and preparation tasks , in a bid to prove their chicken is fresh and there 's nothing to hide			1
' they 'll see exactly how it 's done , they 'll get to look in the fridges at the ingredients and the products we 've got , they 'll be able to watch the cooks making the chicken and the burgers being assembled and how its eventually served to the customer			0
' ms @entity50 said the fast food giant hoped to dispel ' blanket perceptions ' of negativity around the quality and freshness of their ingredients			1
' it 's not something that 's made in a factory offsite somewhere and it gets delivered here and we reheat it , ' she said			0
' if you look at the ingredients and processes we use , it 's actually like fabulous home cooked food , and it 's just done in a slightly bigger commercial kitchen			2

a store manager confirmed that the gravy was made from a combination of the run off from chicken cooked in the store and packets of potato			0

however @entity167 from the @entity168 warned consumers not to equate @entity1 's attempt to build customer trust through displaying respectable food safety standards and their message of ' freshness ' , with healthiness			1
' regardless of the freshness of the chicken , @entity1 's biggest selling products are still prepared in a manner that leaves them high in things like fat and salt , ' ms @entity167 told @entity56			2
' we would encourage attempts by @entity1 to increase the transparency of their operations and provide interested customers with an insight into how their food is prepared			1
at the same time , it 's important not to pretend that this is about the healthiness of @entity1 's range			2

' we 'd like to see @entity1 demonstrating innovation in progressively reducing salt , sugar and fat from its products together with other initiatives like restricting portion sizes and continuing to offer healthier options in the product range			2

' it was really good to see all the hygiene standards that they 've got , ' @entity237 ( pictured ) said ' it 's still deep fried chicken , but knowing that its cooked properly and that it does n't just sit there all day makes it somewhat better , ' he added ' it was really good to see all the hygiene standards that they 've got , especially the hold times for the chicken [ 20 to 90 minutes ] and the checking of the chicken so they make sure its cooked every morning , ' @entity237 , 26 , said			1
' it 's always hard to tell whether the people that work actually care enough to follow all the procedures , but they have quite detailed things like how many times you have to shake the chicken [ when flouring ]			0
