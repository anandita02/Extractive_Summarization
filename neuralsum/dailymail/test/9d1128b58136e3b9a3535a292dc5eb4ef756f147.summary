this a carer partying with friends and kissing her boyfriend in the hours after taking cash from two frail pensioners she stole £ 5,000 from			1
@entity6 , 24 , who was jailed for a year today , went out drinking on the same night she used her victims ' bank card to withdraw large amounts of money			1
at her peak she was draining up to £ 300 a day from her disabled victims ' accounts , spending it on nights out and items such as shoes			1
sentenced : @entity6 , 24 , who was jailed for a year today , went out drinking on the same night she used her victims ' bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash , pictured left and right @entity23 posted regular partying pictures of @entity25 not knowing the family of the victims , a couple in their late 80s who have now died , had installed a spy camera and filmed her taking cash			1
officers discovered @entity23 had stolen more than £ 5,000 from the savings of the elderly couple who suffered from mental and physical disabilities			1
@entity23 , of @entity35 , was jailed for 12 months after she pleaded guilty to nine counts of theft			2
@entity40 @entity39 was told she had previously been employed by a company called @entity43 - who are no longer in business - as a carer although she was not part of the team who looked after the couple at their home in @entity52			1
caught : the victims ' family saw money coming from their accounts so set up a camera and filmed her taking money police said the victims both suffered from a number of physical and mental impairments due to their ages , with very poor memories and were largely confined to their home			1
@entity23 lost her job with the care firm but carried on visiting the house regularly on an unofficial basis having befriended the couple			0
the thefts came to light when the couple 's two daughters became concerned when she noticed on her parent 's bank statements that large amounts of cash , in £ 100 , £ 200 and £ 300 amounts , were being withdrawn from cashpoints almost every other day			1
one of those withdrawals was made from an atm in @entity84 at about 2am on april 13 2014 , which could clearly not have been either of the victims			0
the couple 's daughters also found huge amounts had been withdrawn from their father 's savings account			0
the daughters installed a covert cctv camera at the house and caught @entity23 red - handed as she stole cash from the elderly man 's wallet			1
the daughters continued their investigation and managed to identify @entity23 through her @entity25 profile , which also showed her wearing the same clothes as when she stole the money			2
the police were then called			0
after her sentencing today pc @entity106 said : ' @entity23 's actions were utterly reprehensible			0
whatever motivated her , there can be no excuse or justification for stealing more than £ 5,000 from an elderly and frail couple whom she was supposed to care for and look after			2
evidence : the family watched her @entity25 account and matched clothing she wore in pictures to clothing she wore while withdrawing cash ' it is a heinous and appalling crime , made all the more galling by the audacity to post something on @entity25 of her enjoying a night out using cash stolen just hours earlier from an unsuspecting and trusting couple			1
the fact that when the money was stolen she was not even employed as a carer but pretended to be a caring friend just compounds her despicable actions			0
' and one of the saddest parts of this case is that both the man and his wife passed away before they could see justice being done			0
' i would like to pay tribute to the tenacity and determination shown by the couple 's daughters			0
once they suspected something was amiss , they carried out their own investigation and caught @entity23 red - handed on secret cameras			2
' the evidence against @entity23 was therefore overwhelming and no doubt helped to expose her criminality , so i would like to praise the couple 's daughters for doing what this so - called carer should have done and that is protecting a frail , vulnerable couple			2
' i hope this case serves as a stark warning to anyone who is put in a position of trust , like @entity23 was , to look after elderly and vulnerable people			0
' temptation will clearly be there but do you really want to be known as someone who stole from elderly people ? not only will you have that stigma for the rest of your life , but you could also be facing a long prison sentence			0
