a young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry			2
@entity7 , a self - confessed ‘ food person ’ , was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘ kicked in the abdomen ' – whenever she ate , a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘ resolve itself ’ in a matter of days			1
@entity7 , now 29 , was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , and the @entity18 resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube , as the disease , which effects less than .01 per cent of people , would only get worse			1
within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs , she revealed to @entity23 , and had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals			2
mystery illness : @entity27 , pictured , had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in october 2012 ; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half at first , doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing @entity7 ; though she 'd had digestive problems for years , her rare disease was n't initially considered			1
instead , doctors at her local er insisted that she had acute pancreatitis , a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers			2
however , @entity7 's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything — even soup — leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure			1
' it never even changed , ' she said , explaining that when she tried to eat , it felt like she was burning on the inside			0
' it was still ten - out - of - ten pain			2
' three months after her first visit to the emergency room , she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas — a potentially life - threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted			1
literally starving : still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain , @entity7 was constantly hungry — leading her fiancé @entity69 to feel bad eating in front of her rapid weight loss : @entity7 's weight , which is normally at around 110lbs , dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest sufferers of the illness , which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas , have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves , and eventually leads to permanent damage			1
@entity7 spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely , which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her fiancé @entity69			2
' we 're food people , ' she said			0
' we [ love ] to bake , order takeout			0
now he felt bad eating in front of me			0
' luckily , @entity7 found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on @entity91 , some of whom said they found a way to eat : a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas , spleen , gallbladder , appendix , and duodenum , which allows the pancreas ' cells to be transplanted into the liver , enabling it to function as a pancreas			1
so @entity7 flew to a hospital in @entity106 that specializes in the 14 - hour surgery , and scheduled her procedure for january 2014			1
enduring love : @entity7 's wedding to fiancé @entity69 is back on , now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain after her surgery , @entity7 spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again			1
' i was excited , but nervous , since it had been so long since i 'd eaten , ' she said			0
' sure enough , i had chicken broth and juice and it did n't affect anything			0
' she soon began enjoying ice cream , lobster , and pizza , and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs			0
' the number one thing that helped was the support group i joined and knowing other people going through it , ' she said			0
' they saved me and gave me hope			0
' now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery , @entity7 was able to reschedule her wedding to @entity69			1
she will walk down the aisle in october .			0

@entity27 , 29 , felt *severe* pain whenever she ate thanks to the disorder , which developed in october 2012 , when she was 26
she dropped to just 80lbs and doctors told her she would likely need a feeding tube for the rest of her life
diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , @entity7 's only hope was to *undergo* a 14 - hour surgery to remove her pancreas
