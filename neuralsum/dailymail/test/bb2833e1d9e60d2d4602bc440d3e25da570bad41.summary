the mother of a young woman who suffers from lupus , an inflammatory disease which affects the immune system , has hit back at a stranger who left a cruel note on her daughter ’s car claiming she had no right to park in a disabled space – despite the fact that she has a handicap permit			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , took to @entity16 to publicly shame the anonymous note writer , while also defending her daughter @entity19 , a student at @entity21 , and her condition			1
' my first reaction was anger , ' @entity13 told @entity26			2
' on top of everything she deals with she did n't need this			2
@entity32 is very strong , and many times she just lets it go			2
but because she is human i know she feels something			2
' noted : @entity36 , who suffers from lupus , discovered this note on her car after stopping at a @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 keeping up appearances : the disability caused by @entity32 's illness is not visible to others , but presents her with a battle every day the harsh note , which was left on @entity32 ’s car , despite the fact that that her official handicap tag was clearly visible , read : ' you should be ashamed ! when you take a handicap spot , an actual disabled person suffers			1
you were not raised as you should have been			2
' the person who wrote it evidently saw @entity32 walk into the pharmacy unaided , and assumed that she was lying about being disabled			1
in response to the note , @entity32 's mother @entity13 wrote an open letter on @entity16 , hoping it would eventually reach the person whose ignorance had so upset her daughter , and also aiming to raise awareness for non-visible ' ghost diseases ' such as @entity32 's			1
including a photo of the note lying on top of @entity32 's handicap tag , @entity13 wrote in her post : ' to the person who left this on my daughter ’s car			1
you 'd never know : @entity32 may struggle every day , but she continues to persevere , unbeknownst to many of those around her @entity86 knows best : @entity87 ( pictured ) hopes to find the writer of the note and change that person 's - and others ' - perceptions about ' ghost diseases ' ' wishing so much for you to have stopped and talked to this amazing person before leaving this			1
if you had , you would have known that my daughter has a disease			1
' systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its own tissue , leading to inflammation that results in visible swelling and joint pain			0
the disease affects women much more frequently than men and leaves suffers feeling extremely fatigued the condition is also typified by a ' butterfly rash ' which spreads across the face of many with the illness			0
there is no cure for lupus , but most of those afflicted are able to live a normal lifespan on medication			0
@entity13 went on to explain in detail the laborious battle her daughter has been through since being diagnosed with lupus aged 16			1
' it started with her joints swelling and the pain being so bad she could hardly walk , ' @entity13 said			0
' but she continued going to school and keeping up with her community service			0
' the teenager went on to suffer a facial rash and hair loss - and had to attend her prom in a wig			0
she would go on to battle debilitating muscle pain , hearing loss , multiple lung collapses and a month - long stay in the hospital that forced her to postpone her studies			0
but , incredibly , the young lady always made it back - although ' not at 100 per cent ' her mother explained			0
' she struggles every day with permanent damage she has had to one side of her body and with hearing loss , but baby she keeps going ! ' gushed @entity13 in the letter			0
' i think you would love her ' : @entity32 's mother leapt to her daughter 's ( pictured ) defense in an open letter , describing her as a fighter and an ' amazing person ' ' i may not be a perfect parent , but i know i did good with her ! ' @entity13 's letter is finished with a plea to the writer of the note , saying she hopes to find him or her : ' not to tell you how wrong you were in leaving that note ... but to give you the opportunity to meet @entity168			1
i think you would love her [ sic ]			0
' ' people with ghost illnesses are often labeled as lazy or fakes , ' @entity13 told @entity26			1
' we never know what burdens people struggle with			2
often we are so quick to judge or make assumptions , but if we just take the time to ask them , they are often very willing to educate them on it			0
their pain and discomfort is real			0
