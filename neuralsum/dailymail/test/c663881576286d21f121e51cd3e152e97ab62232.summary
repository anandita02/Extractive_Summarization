a carpenter from @entity1 has created what may well be the world ’s biggest see - saw			1
@entity5 , who runs his own custom woodworking business , built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in @entity10			1
it measures a whopping 45ft in length , and according to its maker , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft			1
@entity5 said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the seesaw was born as seen in the video , the seesaw is made from entirely raw materials – a large trunk sits securely in between the natural split of a tree			1
@entity5 told @entity30 : ‘ i was cutting down some dead and damaged trees one day and was trying to drop this tree in between two others			1
‘ it did n't go as planned and ended up dropping in between a tree that had two huge branches splitting			2
‘ it fell basically where it is now but was about 65ft long and was laying on my fence			0
‘ so i cut the tree at what looked like would be even on both sides and just like that a massive teeter totter ( @entity46 term for seesaw ) was born			2
@entity5 climbed the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the trunk into the split branches to stop it from sliding there is no seat attached to the trunk but handrails have been added for support and ropes help people get on ‘ the whole thing kind of just happened			1
it ended up being the perfect weight on both sides			0
‘ i climbed up the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the tree trunk down into the split branches to stop it from sliding			2
‘ i then called up a few of my friends and they came over really quickly once they heard			0
’ while there is no seat attached to the trunk , handrails have been added for support and ropes can be seen dangling from the base of it			2
@entity5 said : ‘ we had to attach a rope on one side so that when one person gets on they can pull the other person up and let someone else on			1
the seesaw measures 45ft in length , and according to @entity5 , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft ‘ i got on with one of my friends and it worked perfectly			1
it was a bit scary at first because it 'll send you about 25ft in the air			0
‘ we used it for about 20 minutes			0
it ’s so much fun			0
it takes the childhood ask of playing on a teeter totter and magnifies it by a thousand			0
‘ basically if you were six - years - old and had never seen a regular teeter totter before that 's what it would be like to see this thing as an adult			0
’ according to @entity5 , four people can ride on the seesaw at one time and there is an amazing view from the top			1
the short clip , captured from two angles , shows two people riding the seesaw – one pumps the air in celebration and swings his dangling legs			2
@entity5 said that the seesaw is a lot of fun and that it takes the childhood memory of playing on one and magnifies it by a thousand @entity5 's woodwork has been featured in the @entity124 , @entity126 ’s @entity125 and the @entity128 competition in @entity1 a number of people have commented positively on the video with one @entity133 user writing : ‘ that and a beer looks like a good time			1
’ the carpenter , who launched his business , @entity136 , in 2010 claims to have developed a passion for woodwork from a young age			0
his work has been featured in the @entity124 , @entity126 ’s @entity125 and the @entity128 competition in @entity1 .			0
