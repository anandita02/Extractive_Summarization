an terrified asthma sufferer was left coughing up blood after accidentally inhaling an earring into her lungs			1
the 41 - year - old woman was getting ready for a party to celebrate the @entity7 when she started to wheeze			2
worried her asthma would get worse and ruin the festivities , she reached into her bag for her inhaler , according to doctors writing in the journal @entity14 reports			0
her blue salbutamol inhaler was uncapped in her bag , and she heard a ‘ coarse rattle ’ when she shook it			2
despite this , she ignored the noise , believing it was due to a loose connection inside the device			0
the 41 - year - old @entity25 woman had a medical emergency on @entity27 after inhaling an earring into her lungs			1
an x-ray shows the earring lodged in her right bronchus - the airway leading to the lungs doctors put a thin tube with a camera on the end known as an endoscope into the woman 's lung , which showed the earring was covered in mucus ( pictured ) she took a deep inspiration , but immediately felt a painful scratch in her throat			1
she began coughing up blood , wheezing and became short of breath , and was rushed by ambulance to the @entity51 department of @entity52 in @entity53 , the report said			1
when she arrived , doctors ordered a chest x-ray , and saw something was wrong straight away			0
there was a mass that had ‘ features consistent with a stud earring ’ , and a ct scan confirmed the earring was stuck in the woman ’s right bronchus , one of the two main airways leading to the lungs			1
doctors prescribed antibiotics to prevent any infection and then put a long , thin tube with a camera on the end into her throat - in a procedure known as an endoscopy			0
they were then able to examine the earring and remove it			0
they found large amounts of mucus around the earring , which was ‘ the body ’s attempt to expel the foreign body ’ dr @entity80 , one of the doctors who treated the woman , told @entity82			2
@entity83 , 48 , almost choked to death when she swallowed a false nail that shot out of her inhaler when she took a puff if they had waited to remove the earring , the woman 's body might have healed over the earring , embedding it within the bronchus , dr @entity88 added			1
the woman made a full recovery , but in the report , doctors said her case highlights the need for people with asthma to be told about the dangers of storing their inhaler without a cap			2
writing in the report , doctors concluded : ‘ the importance of replacing caps on inhalers when not in use is illustrated and should be encouraged when inhaler technique is taught or reviewed			1
’ the news comes after @entity111 reported on the case of @entity83 , 48 , who almost choked to death when she nearly swallowed a false nail that had shot out of her inhaler when she took a breath			2
ms @entity83 , 48 , was at work when she felt her chest tightening and took out her blue salbutamol inhaler			0
she took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat where it became lodged			1
the mother - of - one ran outside in a panic when a neighbour came to her rescue and began pounding her back before calling 999			0
after five minutes of choking , a false nail finally came loose from the back of her throat and fell out onto the pavement			0
she believes the nail may have worked its way inside the inhaler through a gap at the top , and is now urging others to check their inhalers before use			0
