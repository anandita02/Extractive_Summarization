it has been one of the most widely embraced cosmetic procedures of all time , but it seems our love affair with botox may finally be coming to an end			1
@entity9 women are turning away from using botox and fillers after several recent celebrity horror stories – like the recent cases with @entity14 and @entity15			1
more women are choosing so called notox facials and spa treatments instead of injectables – and sales up three times higher in 2014 than previous year			1
the previous week @entity15 shocked many when she appeared at a showbiz event looking completely different to her @entity35 days			2
in both cases over-use of botox and fillers was pointed to as a possible cause and now as a result women are turning away from using them and sales are now in decline for the first time since they were introduced around 12 years ago			1
many are now turning to safer non-invasive anti-ageing treatments and facials which do n't have any negative side - effects			2
beauty industry expert @entity47 said : ' there has been massive switch from injectables to anti-ageing treatments clearly because women are concerned about the effects certainly for over-use of injectables			0
@entity15 shocked many when she appeared at an event ( left ) looking completely different to her @entity35 days ( right ) ' the move to using facials like the @entity60 micro-dermabrasion and oxygen infusion facial which was seen a 200 per cent increase in orders this year , and the @entity66 micro-current facial which has been dubbed the non-surgical facelift			1
' both have seen massive rises in numbers of new clients , and we hear from many of our new clients that they are concerned about over-use of injectables and so in terms of anti-ageing treatments they are turning to preventative measures			0
' @entity9 star @entity81 caused a media storm when she turned up to court to face drug - related charges looking totally different ( left ) than she did in her fresh - faced @entity85 days ( right ) industry insiders have said that the use of fillers and botox is on the decline now for the first time in over 10 years and women are starting to move away , or at least significantly reduce the amount of injectables they have on their faces			1
they appear to be turning instead to procedures such as @entity60 , which is a facial that includes a combined micro-dermabrasion and led light treatment followed by an oxygen infusion of neo-peptide rich serums that inhibit muscle responses and therefore attempts to mimic the effects of botox			0
since it 's launch it has picked up several celebrity fans such as @entity108 's @entity107 , @entity109 from made in @entity110 and @entity111 star @entity111			0
the news that @entity114 use may be in decline comes after recent research revealed that a shocking 84 per cent of youth - seekers admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their faces when under - going the procedure - or even if the injection given actually contained key ingredient @entity122 toxin			2
transform cosmetic surgery , who conducted the research also have seen an alarming 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help following ineffective treatments with non-registered ' faux - tox ' salons			0
worryingly , they say patients come to them after being treated in a non-clinical environment , despite being given a prescription - only medicine .			0

rumors that @entity114 was to blame for celebrities looking bad recently
both @entity14 and @entity15 have appeared looking odd
botox sales in decline for the first time since introduced 12 years ago
sales of *non-injectable* treatments three times higher than last year
