by @entity0 last updated at 8:51 am on 31st january 2012 @entity1 told @entity2 the taxpayer - funded @entity3 was now in ' serious financial difficulty ' victims of violent street attacks left with a dislocated jaw or broken hand will be denied compensation under new cuts			1
@entity12 victims with permanent scarring will also be refused payment as part of reforms announced yesterday by justice secretary @entity1			1
payouts for minor injuries will be scrapped , while those for some more serious injuries will be sharply reduced to focus funding on ‘ support services ’ and the victims of the worst crimes , he said			1
around 15,000 a year will lose out under the changes			1
critics said it was wrong that ‘ innocent victims of crime ’ should suffer			2
mr @entity1 told @entity2 the taxpayer - funded @entity3 was now in ‘ serious financial difficulty ’ with a deficit of more than £ 250million			1
the changes to the scheme will see an end to all payouts for ‘ lower level ’ injuries			0
mr @entity1 said they would affect those with ‘ sprained ankles , broken toes or bruised ribs ’			1
currently there are 25 compensation bands starting at £ 1,000 for minor sprains and fractures , or ‘ temporary mental anxiety ’			2
at the top end victims can receive up to £ 250,000 if they suffer paralysis and very serious brain damage requiring fulltime care			2
under the proposals , awards for the lowest five bands will be scrapped			2
anyone with a minor head injury , such as concussion or headaches lasting up to four months , would be excluded , as would attack victims who have suffered a dislocated jaw or broken hand			2
@entity12 victims who have suffered ‘ minor disfigurement ’ and would otherwise have been given £ 1,500 will also receive nothing			1
more serious injuries , such as a broken foot , moderate burns or a fractured collar bone will see payouts cut			0
victims of violent street attacks left with a dislocated jaw or broken hand will be denied compensation under new cuts a victim who suffered a broken jaw which needed an operation and suffers ‘ continuing significant disability ’ would currently be entitled to £ 8,200 , but this would fall to £ 6,200			1
someone who suffered a fractured skull needing an operation would receive £ 6,600 now , but will see that cut to £ 4,600			0
payouts for moderate facial disfigurement will be cut from £ 5,500 to £ 3,500			0
the amount crime victims would receive for loss of earnings could also be capped at £ 12,600			2
however higher level awards for victims of more serious crimes will be protected , mr @entity1 said , as will payments to the families of murder victims			1
he told the @entity94 the scheme in its current form was ‘ not sustainable ’			0
‘ instead of compensation going to those with less grave injuries and those who have been breaking the law , it will be targeted where it counts – on the most serious injuries , ’ he said			0
@entity12 victims with permanent scarring will also be refused payment as part of reforms announced yesterday by justice secretary @entity1 ‘ the support services which many victims need as much as – or more than – compensation will be available when required , paid for as far as possible by offenders , not the taxpayer			1
‘ for families bereaved by homicide , and those affected by serious violent and sexual crimes , these reforms will move compensation on to a sustainable footing , and at the same time improve the quality and availability of practical support and advice			2
’ but @entity127 justice spokesman @entity126 said the plans appeared to be a ‘ smokescreen , masking much wider and deeper cuts to compensation for those innocent victims of crime			1
’ and @entity134 , from @entity135 said : ‘ if you have been attacked , no matter why you have been attacked you should be compensated in some way			0
‘ we knew there were going to be cuts but these are quite serious injuries and victims should be helped			0
’ mr @entity1 will also scrap compensation for anyone with a criminal record			1
over the past decade around 20,000 criminals have been paid more than £ 75million , including a convicted rapist who was given £ 62,000 and a double killer handed more than £ 27,000			0
based on figures for the last two years , more than 17,000 claims totalling in excess of £ 25million for injuries including sprained ankles , broken toes and dislocated jaws would no longer qualify for compensation under the proposals			0
a further 12,950 claims totalling £ 50million would be reduced			0
current £ 60 fines which are dished out to motorists caught driving , using their mobile phones and speeding , could rise to between £ 80 and £ 100 these would include payouts for brain injuries , such as minor brain damage , well - controlled epilepsy and permanent disabling dislocations and fractures , the @entity164 consultation document said			1
the victims ’ surcharge – a levy on fines issued by the courts which funds support for victims of crime – currently raises about £ 10million each year			1
however , the government also spends about £ 66million on these victim and witness support services			0
in a separate move , victims could be given a greater say in the sentences handed down to offenders , with new rules for judges			0
current guidance means judges should take victims ’ statements into account when passing sentence , but many victims do not realise this			0
in future all victims will be encouraged to make statements expressing the impact a crime has had on them .			0

15,000 a year will lose out under justice secretary @entity1 *'s* changes
@entity12 victims with permanent scarring will also be refused payment
