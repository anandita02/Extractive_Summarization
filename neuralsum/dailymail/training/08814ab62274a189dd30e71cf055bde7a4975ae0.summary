my eight - year - old daughter @entity0 appears in the kitchen looking cross			2
‘ what ’s that disgusting thing bobbing about in the bathroom sink ? ’ she demands			2
‘ it ’s just a silkworm cocoon , ’ i reply airily — much to @entity0 ’s baffled disgust			1
at the age of 46 , there is almost nothing i wo n’t try to keep the years at bay — but this must be the strangest yet			1
frances applying a cocoon to her skin			1
at the age of 46 , there is almost nothing she wo n’t try to keep the years at bay the latest weapon in my anti-ageing arsenal is , in truth , fairly revolting : silkworm cocoons , the casing that silkworms — which are in fact a type of caterpillar — spin for themselves before they turn into moths			1
it is the mulberry silkworm cocoon , the same as used to spin silks in industrial production			1
the cocoons are harvested in @entity38 and shipped to @entity39			2
they look and feel like a tiny , hollow white bird ’s egg covered in embossed wallpaper and have been hailed on internet forums as the latest secret to flawless skin			2
@entity47 uses the mulberry silkworm cocoon , the same as used to spin silks in industrial production			1
the cocoons are harvested in @entity38 and shipped to @entity39			2
according to @entity53 , author of @entity51 , trainee geishas in @entity55 have used them for centuries			2
‘ @entity59 women are obsessed with beautiful skin			2
they are far more comfortable using natural products than many @entity63 women , ’ she says			2
‘ some of our remedies are thousands of years old , ’ adding that it was the youthful hands of women who extracted silk from cocoons in ancient @entity71 and @entity59 that first alerted sharp - eyed matrons to the potential cosmetic benefits of silkworms			1
now the idea has gained traction again thanks to the internet and our new obsession with all things natural			2
even so , the idea of rubbing an insect cocoon on my face horrifies me			1
the silk worm — which look like a white maggot — spins the cocoon from its saliva glands			1
yuck ! the silk worm — which look like a white maggot — spins the cocoon from its saliva glands however , considering my distinctly greying , lined face , i decide it ’s worth a go			1
surprisingly , the cocoons are easy to find			2
when i look them up on @entity96 , i ’m pleased to find they cost a mere £ 3.99 for ten			2
they are described , perfunctorily , beneath a photograph as ‘ white silkworm cocoon facial cleanser ’			1
they turn up three days later in little plastic wallets covered in bubble wrap , without any instructions , or in fact , any information at all			2
thankfully , there is some cursory guidance on the retailer ’s @entity96 page , advising me to soak the cocoon in hot water to soften it , then rub it gently over my face concentrating on lines and blemishes			1
each cocoon should only be used once			1
soaking my first cocoon in the bathroom sink @entity47 was surprised and gratified that it dis n't disintegrate into a sludgy mess before i actually dare to rub the cocoon on my skin , i seek the advice of top cosmetic specialist dr @entity124 — who is surprisingly enthusiastic			1
‘ women have used oils from the cocoon as a moisturiser for over a thousand years			1
it ’s wonderful stuff , packed full of healing properties , ’ he says			2
‘ when you soak the cocoon , you release sericin , the substance that binds the silk thread together			1
this is an amazing protein , containing 18 amino acids , which will definitely help your complexion			0
’ he explains that sericin acts as a thin film over the face , sealing in moisture to keep skin hydrated			0
what ’s more , he says , it ’s been shown to replenish collagen , the substance that keeps skin elastic			0
i decide to put silkworm cocoons to the test by having my skin scientifically analysed before and after using the cocoons			1
to this end , i visit dr @entity154 at the @entity155 , whose skin - analysing @entity157 machine measures the signs of ageing — skin texture , pore size , wrinkles , spots and uv damage			1
depressingly , i do badly on spots — 90 per cent of women my age have clearer skin than me — and my @entity170 damage is worse than half of women my age			1
however the elasticity of my skin is good and i ’m cheered to learn that my pore size is better than three out of four women my age			0
‘ there ’s some discolouration and scarring from acne and there is quite substantial uv damage around your mouth and on your forehead , ’ dr @entity154 says			1
he advises using the cocoons every other day for a month as part of my beauty routine — i apply my usual moisturiser afterwards — before we analyse my skin again			0
soaking my first cocoon in the bathroom sink i ’m surprised and gratified that it does n’t disintegrate into a sludgy mess			1
i leave it for a couple of minutes in hot water , then pop it onto the end of my finger and rub it in a circular motion around my face — concentrating especially on my chin and forehead where i have most acne scarring and sun damage			1
frances with dr @entity154 at the @entity209 , whose skin - analysing @entity157 machine measures the signs of ageing — skin texture , pore size , wrinkles , spots and uv damage the cocoon feels slightly abrasive and surprisingly solid for something that ’s been soaking			1
it certainly does n’t feel greasy			1
afterwards my skin has a sort of pinkish glow			0
i wonder if i ’ve overdone it and simply peeled off the top layer of skin			0
applying my moisturiser , my face feels a bit raw			0
it stings a little and i resolve to be gentler next time			0
looking at my face the next day , i ca n’t see any difference at all			1
in fact all week and then into the second week , there ’s no change			0
in all honesty , i ’m highly suspicious of these cheap white cocoons with their bubble - wrap packaging			0
i like my cosmetics to smell lovely and be beautifully boxed			0
while the elasticity of @entity208 ' skin was good for her age , she did less well on the number of spots she gets by the third week , the novelty of soaking my cocoons has worn off , and i ’m convinced it ’s just a gimmick not worth 4p , never mind £ 4			1
to top it all , i start to get a nasty spot near the right side of my mouth			0
i can feel it coming up on tuesday evening and rubbing the cocoon over it , i wonder whether i ’m doing more harm than good			1
on wednesday morning however , the spot is shrinking			0
it hovers beneath the surface of my skin for a couple of days and then , miraculously , it slinks away			0
at the same time , i notice my skin feels softer , and my complexion looks a little bit plumper and fuller			0
peering into the mirror , i wonder whether i ’m imagining things			0
@entity47 ' acne spots , @entity170 damage and scarring improved by 20 per cent a quick internet search reveals an answer : it turns out any new skin regime will take around four weeks to work , as that ’s how long it takes the skin the renew itself			1
meeting my friend @entity274 for lunch , she stares at me quizzically before asking what on earth i ’ve been doing to my face			0
‘ you look much less wrinkly , ’ she says bluntly , adding that i look five years younger			2
dr @entity154 , too , when i see him at the end of the month tells me that my skin looks much better			0
‘ your complexion is clearer and smoother			0
i can see that without the @entity157 , ’ he says			0
the results from the @entity157 are astounding			0
my acne spots , uv damage and scarring have improved by 20 per cent and the texture of my skin is now better than 96 per cent of women my age — an improvement of 20 per cent			1
my wrinkles too , have noticeably softened , especially around the mouth and eyes			0
analysing the results , dr @entity154 is impressed			0
‘ for a completely natural product with no side - effects this is pretty stunning , ’ he says			0
he tells me that my results are backed up by a study in the @entity302 , which demonstrated sericin ’s hydrating and healing properties			0
the only way that my skin could have shown an improvement of that magnitude , he says , is by increased collagen			0
‘ the sericin in the cocoon has clearly promoted collagen production			2
this explains the healing of acne scars , the increased elasticity and the huge improvement in pigmentation and uv damage			1
i ’d carry on using those cocoons if i were you , ’ he says			0
as we leave the clinic i notice the nurse on her @entity324			0
‘ what are you doing ? ’ i ask			0
‘ ordering some of those cocoons of course , ’ she replies .			0
