by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 20 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:29 est , 22 november 2013 a @entity5 woman 's leg has ballooned to five stone after it became infected with parasites			2
@entity8 , 35 , has been shunned by her friends and neighbours because they are convinced she has been possessed by the @entity11			1
the mother - of - two contracted elephantiasis and , as a result , is immobile and unable to feed her children			1
@entity8 , 35 , was shunned by her friends and neighbours in @entity5 because they became convinced she had been possessed by the @entity11 when she contracted elephantiasis @entity19 , nine , and @entity20 , seven , are now forced to wander the streets begging for scraps to keep their family alive			1
the children even hug their mother goodbye each night believing she will be dead in the morning			0
but now , ms @entity8 has been given hope by a @entity29 surgeon who has offered to carry out life - saving surgery free of charge			1
a charity is trying to raise funds to fly ms @entity8 to the @entity29 so top vascular surgeon professor @entity33 can perform the 10 hour operation			1
surgeons in @entity36 , @entity37 , refused to treat her because they do not have the expertise or facilities , but without treatment it is likely she will die prematurely if an infection occurs			2
ms @entity8 , whose first husband was shot dead in front of her by bandits , said : ‘ please save my life			1
i have been abandoned and the world is not within my reach			0
’ in 2006 , ms @entity8 became ill after picking up an infection			1
slowly her left leg began to swell and she now has severe lymphedema caused by ‘ elephantiasis parasitic infection ’			1
the @entity29 - based @entity53 found her abandoned and destitute after she was cast out by her community and decided to act to help her			1
they are now battling to get visas and passports so ms @entity8 can be flown to the @entity29			1
professor @entity33 , head of the @entity59 and professor of vascular surgery and @entity61 at @entity62 , has even offered to waive his fees to save her			1
he said : ‘ this very unfortunate lady has elephantiasis which is a neglected tropical disease and is a type of acquired lymphoedema caused by the lymphatics - which drain fluid from the tissues - becoming blocked by a parasitic worm			1
her children have to beg for food on the streets as she is immobile so is unable to feed them			1
without treatment she will probably contract a fatal infection ‘ at this very late stage the tissues of the leg are fibrotic , scarred and far beyond treatment of the worm itself , which is now dead			1
‘ i am an acknowledged expert in the management of lymphoedema and this is one of the most extreme cases i have seen			0
this lady must be virtually immobile			2
@entity89 ' medical name is lymphatic filariasis			0
it is a tropical disease that occurs when parasites are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes			0
the parasites are deposited on a person 's skin from where they enter the body and migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms			2
the infection usually occurs in childhood but the disfiguring effects are not often seen until adulthood			2
it can cause permanent disability			0
the majority of people who are infected by the parasite do not develop any symptoms but in acute cases elephantiasis can develop			2
the swelling is usually the result of a bacterial skin infection after normal immune defences have been partially lost due to lymphatic damage			2
the parasites can be cleared from the body with drug treatment but if elephantiasis has developed , complex surgery can be required			2
source : @entity126 ‘ the operation to treat her is very complex and will take possibly eight to 10 hours			0
‘ it requires the most sophisticated management of blood and fluid loss and i respect the surgeons in @entity37 for saying that they are unable to treat her			2
‘ without treatment she will die prematurely of overwhelming infection if cellulitis occurs			0
‘ eventually she will become completely immobile			0
because this involves the whole length of her leg up to the groin , amputation is not an option and would not be possible			0
‘ excision with reconstruction and skin - grafting are required if anything is to be done to help this lady			0
’ the charity needs to raise at least £ 30,000 to fly ms @entity8 to the @entity29 , book a theatre and cover private care after the operation			1
@entity154 , trustee of @entity155 @entity29 , has written to @entity156 and the @entity157 in a desperate bid to raise awareness			1
he said : ‘ if @entity8 does n't get help soon she will die			1
every day her life is becoming more and more difficult			0
’ ‘ on top of her depilating condition , she 's ostracised in her local community where elders believe she 's possessed and a product of witchcraft			0
‘ people think @entity8 must have @entity169 or cancer			1
they call her the “ evil woman ”			0
there is such ignorance and we are trying everything we can to save this woman 's life			0
‘ @entity8 's kids are confused too			1
they thought they would grow the same leg because it must be a genetic deformity			0
‘ @entity8 's story really touched me and on the phone she could not stop bursting into tears			2
‘ she begged me to call her twice every day to see if she was alive and to help her kids if the worst happens			0
‘ i have done so ever since , and beg that people join me in resolving her ordeal			0
‘ we 're calling on the @entity29 public to donate whatever they can to get @entity8 the help she desperately needs			1
’ donations of up to £ 10 can be made by texting @entity194 and then the amount to text 70070			0

@entity8 , 35 , is immobile and unable to feed her @entity202 leg swelled because the drainage passages in it became blocked by a parasitic worm
she could develop a fatal infection at any time if she is not treated
@entity29 surgeon @entity33 has now offered to carry out life - saving surgery for free , so a charity is raising money to fly @entity8 to the @entity29
