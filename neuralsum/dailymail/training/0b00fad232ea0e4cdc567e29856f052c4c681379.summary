' i think that maybe he was doing that to vent his anger , he was telling ( it ) to someone who was close - his wife			0
' that 's an argument @entity15 's defense would likely use if the case goes to trial - and perhaps an argument that could keep the emails away from a jury entirely , said @entity310 , a criminal defense attorney			2
his attorney will likely argue that @entity15 never intended to act on his writings , and was simply expressing his anguish			2
