by @entity0 for @entity1 it is one of the most natural things in the world to do , but for centuries women have been criticised and prevented from breastfeeding their child in public			1
even in the @entity10 , western mothers are stopped from providing milk to their baby in everyday places like coffee shops , leisure centres and department stores			0
but a new poll undertaken this week shows that 80 per cent of people now think it is ok for a woman to bare the boob in a restaurant or bar in order to feed a hungry baby and 67 per cent of people polled believe that a woman should be able to breastfeed anywhere in public			1
many mums still feel uncomfortable about breast feeding in public ( as posed by model ) , although now 80 per cent of people in a new survey believe it is an acceptable practice in restaurants and bars			1
20 per cent of people still felt that anywhere that people eat or drink is an unacceptable place for a woman to breastfeed			0
figures for mums undertaking the practice on public transport are better , with only 18 per cent of people claiming that they would be offended to see a woman openly breastfeeding on trains , buses or aeroplanes			1
the positive results come off the back of a surge in young female celebrities posting snaps of themselves breastfeeding their children on social networking sites like @entity56			0
most recently , the actress @entity57 posed while breastfeeding her newborn in a photo - shoot for @entity60			0
she told the publication : ' being shot with @entity63 is so perfect because any portrait of me right now is n't complete without my identity as a mother being part of that , breastfeeding is the most natural thing			2
actress @entity57 ( pictured with son @entity63 ) caused a media storm when this snap was published in @entity60 magazine ' i do n't know , now it feels like @entity63 should always be on my breast			2
' celebrity mums including @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 has also got in on the act , posted pictures of themselves breastfeeding to social networking sites			2
@entity84 , @entity85 for the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) said of the survey : ' the figures are positive overall but there is still work to do to bring the minority of people into the 21st century			1
' it ’s important that not only families but businesses know it is illegal to discriminate against a woman because she is breastfeeding – a law that sits under the @entity99			0
' @entity101 or breastfeeding , mothers needs to be able to feed their baby whenever and wherever they need it			2
' but while the large majority of the population believe that it is ok for a mum to breastfeed in public , there is still a minority who hold strong opinions about the practice not happening in several specific places			0
@entity78 posted a snap of herself feeding her daughter while having her hair , nails and make - up done to her @entity121 page 17 per cent of people still struggle to see breastfeeding in leisure centres or swimming pools areas though , which would still force women into damp changing rooms to nourish their baby			1
in the poll commissioned by myvouchercodes.co.uk , taking part in retail therapy would also be difficult for some mums , with 17 per cent of people believing it is inappropriate to breastfeed in shops			0
and 15.5 per cent of people would n't tolerate a glimpse of a woman 's chest in a town or city centre altogether			1
@entity80 uploaded this scenic snap of her breastfeeding to @entity56 the last statistic echoes the experience of @entity145 , 27 , when a passer - by took a picture of her breastfeeding her child while sitting on a step in @entity150 , @entity151 , and posted it on @entity152 with the caption : ' i know the sun is out n all that but there 's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town ! ! ! tramp '			1
the snap caused outrage among women 's rights campaigners and mothers ' groups , with several protest sit - ins taking place as a result			0
@entity145 later appeared on @entity173 's @entity172 to speak out : ' i was showing a lot less flesh than a lot of people do - i was n't sitting there with my breast out			1
@entity181 mum : @entity79 uploaded this snap of her breastfeeding while in the make - up chair to @entity121 in 2011 ' breastfeeding mums are n't doing it to antagonise people or gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies ' needs			1
' why should mothers who are doing the best by their children feel that they should be confined to a toilet or changing room to provide their baby with nutrients ? ' would you eat in a toilet or with a blanket draped over your face ? ' over the past ten years , @entity204 surveys of breastfeeding mums have shown less and less are having negative experiences while feeding their child in public spaces			2
in 2006 , @entity209 reported that more than one fifth of mothers had either been told to stop breastfeeding or were made to feel uncomfortable by something somebody said whilst they breastfed in public			0
in 2010 , the @entity216 reported that just over one in ten mums said that they had been stopped in public or been made to feel uncomfortable doing so .			0

polls says only 18 per cent *dislike* seeing breastfeeding on public transport
15.5 per cent do n't think mums should breast feed at all in town centres
@entity86 says there 's still work to be done
