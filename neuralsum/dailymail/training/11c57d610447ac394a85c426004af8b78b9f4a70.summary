many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies			0
now , a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics , by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office , women like to be part of a team			1
the results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues ’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work , rather than that of a team ’s			1
a new study claims that while men enjoy competition in the office ( illustrated with a stock image ) , women like to be part of a team			1
the results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues ’ ability than women and were more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work , rather than that of a team researchers from @entity35 in @entity36 and the @entity37 , analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team			1
they found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment , in comparison to 44 per cent of women			2
the experts believe the reason for this is that men are more likely to think their colleagues may let them down and that even high - performing women were attracted by team working			1
however , it is worth noting that the majority of both the sexes were keen to compete in the workplace on their own terms			2
‘ while women tend to shy away from competition , the results suggest that men shy away from cooperation , ’ said study author @entity59 , professor of economics at the @entity37			1
a stock image of two women working together is shown women dislike having a female boss at work more than men do , a previous study revealed			1
nearly 40 per cent of female workers in @entity76 would rather be led by a man , a @entity74 survey found in october last year			0
in contrast , just over one quarter of men would prefer a male boss , with 58 per cent not caring either way			1
the study , which collected responses from 1,032 @entity76 adults , found that only one - fifth of people would prefer to have a female boss if they were to take a new job			1
but it also revealed that workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman , compared to those with a male boss , at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively			0
‘ while women tend to shy away from competition , the results suggest that men shy away from cooperation , ’ said study author @entity59 , professor of economics at the @entity37			1
‘ in fact , while part of the decision is a matter of preferences , the difference is mainly explained by the fact that compared with men , women hold much less pessimistic beliefs about the relative performance of their potential team members			2
’ the study , published in the @entity114 , also found that when there was a small economic advantage to working in a team , a similar number of men and women chose it			1
previous research has found that men react more strongly to monetary incentives so a small financial incentive may boost men ’s enthusiasm for working in teams especially			1
co-author professor @entity129 , of @entity130 , said : ‘ individuals who choose the team compensation scheme tend to perform less well on average than those who choose to be paid based on their own performance			2
‘ this results from the fact that the less able workers anticipate that by joining a team , they can improve their earnings thanks to the higher productivity of their colleagues			2
but this is less true for women than for men			0
’ the study , published in the @entity114 , also found that when there was a small economic advantage to working in a team ( illustrated with a stock image ) , a similar number of men and women chose it although the number of female ceos of @entity156 companies reached a historic high in 2014 , only 4.8 per cent of this elite group are women			1
last year , a @entity161 study found that women are still lacking in self - confidence , not putting themselves forward for promotion , and perceive men to have advantages over them			1
a quarter of the women ( 26 per cent ) interviewed said they felt that adopting stereotypical male characteristics could help them to get to the top of their field			0
meanwhile , one in five women ( 20 per cent ) believed gender discrimination at work had made it more difficult for them to reach their career goals			0
and over a third ( 38 per cent ) said lack of confidence in their own abilities and a reluctance to push for promotions ( 37 per cent ) was making it harder for them to reach progress up the ladder			0
other potential barriers for women making the leap into management positions were found to include lack of flexible working arrangements to allow for childcare and the ' negative ' attitudes of employers and colleagues with regard to balancing work and family life			2
previous studies have argued that women are reluctant to enter jobs or sectors that thrive on competitive behaviour , while men , in contrast , are more attracted to competition - a view unpopular with some feminists			2
professor @entity129 said : ‘ there is no doubt that reaching top positions in business or winning an election requires competitiveness			0
‘ but if women tend to avoid competitive environments , it seems important to have a better understanding of which types of working environments do attract women , and how women fare relative to men in those environments			2
‘ in particular , are women more attracted than men to cooperative working environments ? the findings of this research suggest that the answer is yes			0
’ ceo and author @entity233 , who has written a book about competition in the workplace disagrees that women are n't as competative as men			0
she cites behavioural economist @entity240 who found that in matriarchal societies , the women are the more competitive sex			0
' in other words , coming from a culture in which they were accustomed to power and success , women were more than willing to enter the fray , ' she wrote in the @entity250			0
' the problem is n't , therefore , that women are n't competitive			0
the problem is that , in our society , they 're smart and able enough to see that they 're unlikely to win			0
' ' ... it 's evident that while many well - performing female hurt themselves financially by shying away from competition , poorly performing males also hurt themselves by embracing it			0

study was conducted by @entity35 and @entity37 experts
it suggests that men prefer being rewarded for their own work because they tend to have a dim view of their colleagues ' abilities
both sexes chose to work in teams if there was an economic incentive
