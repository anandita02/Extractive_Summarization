this is thought to be because of increasing rates of childhood obesity			0
@entity14 researchers have found that white girls start to develop breasts at about nine and a half - a few months earlier than in the 1990s			1
@entity18 girls , on the other hand , now start to develop breasts just before they turn nine , on average			1
the researchers studied data from 1,200 @entity18 girls who were enrolled in the study between the ages of six and eight			2
at each check - up , experts assessed the girls ’ breast development			0
they found @entity18 girls first show signs of breast development at eight years and 10 months , on average			1
hispanic girls first show signs of breast development at nine years and four months on average , and white and @entity39 girls at nine years and eight months			2
for white girls , they found that puberty is now hitting about four months earlier than in a 1997 study that also measured breast development			1
they also discovered that heavier girls tend to start developing breasts at a younger age			1
as a result , dr @entity47 and his colleagues at @entity49 in @entity50 wrote in the journal @entity53 that rising obesity rates seem to be a ‘ prime driver ’ behind breast development starting earlier			0
there are a number of theories as to why obesity might be linked to earlier onset of puberty			2
researchers at @entity63 believe it could be because diet plays havoc with the body clock which , in turn , changes the balance of hormones in the body			2
another theory is that carrying excess fat tissue encourages the body to produces hormones which kick start puberty			1
however , dr @entity77 , head of the @entity78 at @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , has carried out research which suggests obesity is not behind the earlier development of breasts			2
he believes exercise levels and chemicals in the environment play a role in causing the onset of puberty			0
@entity18 girls now start to develop breasts just before they turn nine , on average , while white girls start to develop breasts at about nine and a half			1
this is a few months earlier than in the 1990s the researchers believe that maturing at a younger age could come with long - term risks for some girls			1
for instance , those who hit puberty earlier could be at higher risk of breast and other cancers because their bodies spend more years making , and being exposed to , oestrogen			1
they also tend to start having sex or using drugs and alcohol at younger ages and are more likely to become depressed or develop low self - esteem , they said			0
‘ you 've got a 10 - year - old who looks like a 14 - year - old			0
we interact with kids based on the way that they look , ’ dr @entity47 said			0
‘ kids interact with each other that way also			0
’ ‘ one of the things the parents of these early maturing kids need to do is they need to monitor them more closely , ’ he told @entity128			0
‘ that includes talking about sex earlier			0
’ but dr @entity77 said parents should n't be overly worried , as the data about early puberty and problems down the line come from studies that asked women when they first got their period and this was not measured in this study			2
‘ i think the scary part is not ( for ) the actual girl , because we do n't know what it means for her , ’ he told @entity128			0
‘ it is a warning that something is influencing our child population and it calls for concern and continued studies			0

@entity18 girls now start to develop breasts at eight years and ten months , on average , and white girls at nine years and eight months
this is about four months earlier than in the 1990s
heavier girls start to develop breasts at an earlier age than slim girls
this could be because carrying excess fat tissue encourages the body to produce the hormones that kick start puberty earlier
early puberty has been linked to an increased risk of some cancers
