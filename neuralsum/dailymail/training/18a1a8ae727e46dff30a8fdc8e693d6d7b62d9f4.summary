wire - free pacemakers the size of a pill have been fitted in @entity4 patients for the first time			1
the operations have been described as a ‘ milestone moment ’ that could revolutionise the treatment of heart rhythm problems and cut the risks linked to traditional pacemakers			1
the new pacemaker , a tenth of the size of current devices , is the smallest in the world and is tucked inside the heart itself via a catheter			1
revolution : the new wireless pacemaker has been fitted on two men at @entity23 as it is self - contained , it dispenses with wiring into the heart needed by normal pacemakers , which often breaks and means the patient ’s chest has to be opened again			1
and , as the surgery involved with the new device is minimal , it should reduce the danger of potentially lethal infections developing , and the patient ’s recovery time is rapid			0
professor @entity37 , who operated at @entity23 on a man in his early 20s and one in his mid 60s , said that while the existing technology is ‘ fantastic ’ and has ‘ saved countless lives ’ , it has its drawbacks			0
pacemakers regulate the heart ’s rhythm and are implanted in more than 40,000 patients in @entity49 each year			1
although they have been getting smaller in recent years – the first to be implanted , in the 1950s , were the size of a small tin of shoe polish – they are still too big to be placed inside the heart itself and so are put in the upper chest			1
new life : student @entity59 , 21 , from @entity23 , was one of the two @entity4 patients who received the smallest pacemaker in the @entity4 this involves a wound up to 2in across			1
the pacemaker is then connected to the heart via wires , but these can be pulled out of place or snap over time			2
this happens in more than one in 100 cases and means the patient will have to have a second , more complicated , operation			0
in contrast , the new device , called the @entity76 , is small enough to be ferried into the heart via a catheter that is passed up through the groin			2
and , because it is placed in the heart , there are no wires to be attached			0
professor @entity37 , who also holds an honorary post at @entity86 , said : ‘ while pacemakers have saved countless thousands of lives over the past seven decades since the first devices were implanted , one of the major drawbacks has been complications related to the pacing lead that is put in to deliver electrical impulses to the heart			2
‘ this is a big step forward in patient treatment and a milestone for cardiac rhythm management in the @entity4			1
’ - professor @entity37 ‘ now we have pacemakers that are so small - not much larger than an antibiotic pill - they can be attached directly to the inside of the heart , all the problems related to the old - fashioned pacemaker lead are abolished			1
’ the simpler operation takes as little as ten minutes and patients can get back to normal in just two to three days , compared with six weeks currently			0
student @entity59 , who had a very slow heartbeat that was sapping his energy , opted for the new device because he did not want to be left with a large scar on his chest at the age of 21			0
mr @entity59 , of @entity23 , said : ‘ every time i stood up , i was dizzy and light - headed			0
now i ’m a lot happier			0
’ the @entity23 operations are part of a @entity122 - wide trial of one of three miniature , wireless pacemakers that are in development			2
the device , made by @entity128 firm @entity127 , could be suitable for around a third of pacemaker operations			2
professor @entity37 said : ‘ this is a big step forward in patient treatment and a milestone for cardiac rhythm management in the @entity4			1
’ @entity136 , of the @entity137 , said : ‘ there has been an impressive evolution in pacemaker design and efficiency over the years			0
‘ this new development promises to be more remarkable as it is wireless , minimally invasive and carries fewer complications			0
‘ however , it ’s important that we patiently await the completion of this study before this novel device is considered for general public use			0

wireless pacemaker fitted on two patients in the @entity4

the new device is a tenth of the size of current pacemakers
