' super-bike : shortly before he died , dr @entity7 sent a text message to his brother claiming to have ' pulled a wheelie at 155mph ' while test riding a @entity28 @entity9 motorbike , pictured salesmen at the @entity28 garage raised the alarm after dr @entity7 failed to return the superbike , which retails at more than £ 12,000 , to them after he took it for a test drive			1
police then searched through the night for the missing father - of - three before they discovered his body lying in a ditch at the side of the 50mph road			0
the red , white and blue motorcycle had barely been damaged despite being thrown over a nearby hedge in the impact of the crash			0
an inquest into the 39 - year - old ’s death heard how he had only passed his motorcycle test in november 2011 , when he bought his first bike - a @entity51			0
earlier this year dr @entity7 test drove the @entity28 , which was originally built to compete in the 2009 superbike championships and has a top speed of 185mph			1
' he kitted himself out with the best available motorcycle clothing and crash helmet , this was in his meticulous nature - to be the best and have the best , ' said dr @entity7 ’s brother @entity59 , in a statement read at the inquest			1
' four months after buying the bike he had a test drive of the @entity63			2
he considered it to be the best bike around			0
his opinion was that if he could ride this bike he could ride anything			0
' on june 23 , dr @entity7 booked another test ride at a @entity28 garage in north @entity71			1
he left his @entity51 at the garage and set off on the @entity28 at 1pm for a two - hour ride but worried salesmen called police when he had not returned by 5pm			2
his body was found more than 12 hours later , at 5.20am by police officers combing the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , around nine miles from the garage			2
successful : dr @entity7 worked as a consultant cardiac anaesthetist at @entity83 the bike was found leaned against a hedge around 40 yards away with its back light and registration plate missing			1
police analysis of his phone revealed that dr @entity7 had sent the @entity91 message from his mobile at 2.30pm , placing his time of death between that moment and 3pm when the bike had been due back			1
a post mortem examination revealed that dr @entity7 , who worked at @entity83 , @entity98 , had died from multiple injuries			1
collision investigator @entity100 told the hearing in @entity71 that he believed dr @entity7 had been going too quickly to negotiate the double road bend			1
he said that there was no evidence to suggest that another vehicle had been involved			0
mr @entity100 said that he did not know how fast dr @entity7 had been travelling and that the 115mph claim could not be confirmed			1
' whilst this ca n’t be verified , it gives an indication as the speed is very specific , and nowhere near the 185mph the bike was capable of , ' he said			0
' it ’s highly likely the rider entered the bend too fast for his ability and was carrying too much speed to negotiate the second bend			0
' he told the hearing that he believed the bike had bounced off dr @entity7 , causing his chest injuries , before coming to rest			2
he said it appeared that dr @entity7 had been trying to slow down as he came to the second bend			2
@entity123 told the hearing that there was an anti-wheelie mechanism on the bike , which meant that it could not perform the trick in sixth gear , and that his brother could have exaggerated in his message			0
' it might be there was an element of exaggeration in that type of message , ' said @entity80 coroner @entity137			0
' it ’s something that anyone would say for effect , as to the actual speed at the time there is n’t any physical evidence but we do know he lost control			0
' mr @entity137 recorded that the death of dr @entity7 , of @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity98 , had been an accident			1
' we know the message sent at 14.30pm indicated excessive speed but i think perhaps it would be dangerous to read too much into that , ” he said			0
' i think however the fact he did lose control of the motorcycle at the location does suggest too much speed			0
