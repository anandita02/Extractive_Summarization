baby wipes are leaving children with an itchy , scaly and red rash which is often misdiagnosed as a more serious skin condition , a study revealed today			1
an allergic reaction to moist wipes is believed to be behind the rash which is being mistaken for conditions such as eczema , impetigo and psoriasis			2
dr @entity13 , a professor of dermatology and pediatrics at the @entity16 , said that she has seen six children with the mysterious rash over the past two years			1

her first patient was an 8 - year - old girl who had a rash around her mouth and on her buttocks			0

the doctor explained that she remembered a @entity41 study which was done after a patient reacted badly to methylisothiazolinone - a chemical that is often found in baby wipes , hand creams and lotions			1
in recent years , some manufactures have also upped the concentration of the chemical in cosmetic products , often by up to 25 times			2

following the initial patient , dr @entity23 saw five other similar cases in the next two years			2
the doctor told @entity64 that parents need not throw away packets of wipes but just limit their use			0
she told @entity64 : ' i have three kids , so i know how hard it is to do the changes , especially when you ’re traveling			0
