a one - of - a - kind @entity1 fighter plane brought back to life a century after a painstaking reconstruction is up and running in time for its centenary			1
the @entity5 - of which only three prototypes were built - was created as a ' high altitude ' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the @entity10			1
the aircraft was designed to be launched from platforms on battleships , cruisers and even torpedo boats			0
ready for take off : the @entity5 - a @entity1 prototype plane - will take to the skies again this weekend after being rebuilt by a team of 60 volunteers at the @entity20 ready to go : the plane was fired up for the first time today and taken out of the hangar before it flies again this weekend 100 years after the outbreak of the @entity1 gunner : aircraft engineer @entity25 points the firearm on the front of the plane			1
it was designed to shoot down @entity10 now the replica has been made by an army of 60 volunteers who worked from faded plans and two photographs			1
built with an original wooden frame covered in linen , and using a mixture of specifically - made and re-used materials , the aircraft has been brought back to life at the @entity20			1
and today the engine was turned on for the first time as the plane took a turn at @entity44 , @entity45			2
@entity46 , manager of the @entity20 , said : ' it went really well			2
we rolled it out of the hangar and then the engine coughed into life			0
' it 's been four years of hard work by our volunteers , a long struggle in the workshop			0
obviously we were working from old plans , and a lot of the parts have been tricky , we 've had to have things specially made and other bits re-used from existing items			0
rebuilt : the replica @entity65 which has been brought back to life a century after the prototype was made flying again : with an original wooden frame covered in linen , and using a mixture of specifically - made and re-used materials , the aircraft has been brought back to life at the @entity20 ' but it 's been worth it , to see the plane running was wonderful			1
worth all the hard work			0
' i 'm especially glad we got it up and running in time for the 100th anniversary of @entity1 particularly now that the public are starting to appreciate how brave the men were 100 years ago			2
' he added that the plane was designed in the earliest days of aviation - more than a decade before @entity87 became the first man to cross the @entity89 in 1927			2
mr @entity46 added : ' the aircrafts were only a decade old , they were still being invented as people were risking their lives and going up in them			0
' over 9,500 pilots were killed in @entity1 , and it 's only right that we should be remembering them as brave and courageous - so i 'm glad we 've been able to show the kitten this year			2
' the original design only made allowance for a 45 horsepower engine			0
the framework of the remade one - seater aircraft was crafted in the 1980s , but after the wooden skeleton was completed , work halted			2
back to life : volunteers @entity106 ( left ) and @entity107 ( right ) pose with a replica of the @entity5 prototype			1
the aircraft has been built using an original wooden frame and the engine of a @entity113 framework : around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the @entity20 , working from only two photographs and faded plans			1
above , the reproduction 's original wooden framework powering up : mr @entity107 works on the plane 's 500cc twin - opposed engine , featuring twin - opposed cylinders armed : mr @entity106 poses with the aircraft 's @entity127 gun , which was mounted on to the aircraft 's top wing weights take - off weight - 266kg empty weight - 154kg dimensions @entity134 - 19ft 12in length - 16ft 7in height - 5ft 2in wing area - 106.02 sq ft performance maximum speed - 94mph it was taken up again four years ago by volunteers at the museum , working from the faded @entity142 plan and two photographs			1
it was constructed with specifically made materials such as the engine cowlings , and reused materials , such as the twin - opposed engine , sourced from a @entity113 unit with similar twin opposed cylinders , stripped down to make it light and take unnecessary parts such as the cooling fans and starter motor			0
the propeller was acquired from one of the museum 's local flying clubs			0
instruments inside the cockpit came from the national collection archives			0
and the seating and padding around the controls have all been made with leather			0
a gun , which fits on top of the aircraft , was also made to measure			0
plans : one of the original pictures of the 1917 @entity5 that the team of volunteers were working from mr @entity46 said : ' it was to be a disposable , one - operation aircraft , to simply go up , intercept and shoot down the airship , then ditch in the sea			1
' when you work on it , you think this must have been quite a frightening prospect , somebody had to get into this tiny aircraft and get up to ten or 15,000 feet with such a small engine , shoot at the huge airship , then crash into the sea and get out as soon as they could			1
' but there were people willing to do it , some very gutsy people			0
' in total , the aircraft cost around £ 10,000 to restore			0
the prototype made its first flight on september 1 , 1917 but further alterations were needed - and by the time it was finally airworthy , the threat from airships had receded			2
prototype : the @entity5 , featuring a 45 horsepower engine , made its first flight in september 1917 fighter plane : it was designed as a ' high altitude ' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the @entity10			1
however , the one - seater aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production historic : volunteers used instruments from the national collection archives for the replica 's cockpit ( pictured ) prepared to fire : the @entity127 gun ( pictured ) was a key feature of the original @entity1 fighter plane four years ' work : the replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum 's @entity223 shows on april 6			1

@entity5 restored to former glory at @entity20
replica features @entity127 gun , wooden frame and @entity232 engine
prototype was designed as ' high altitude ' fighter during @entity1
it was designed for one flight only to shoot down an airship before the pilot ditched into the sea and tried to escape
team of 60 volunteers remade the plane from faded plans and two photos
