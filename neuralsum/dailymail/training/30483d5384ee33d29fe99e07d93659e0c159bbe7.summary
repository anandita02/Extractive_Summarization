eight families were evacuated from their homes to escape a major rat infestation after vermin were spotted running through kitchen cupboards			1
the plague of rats wreaked havoc by gnawing through water pipes and electrical wires , causing leaks and power cuts at the properties on the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the five - year infestation was so severe that repairmen at the housing association homes refused to enter , furious tenants claimed as they were moved to temporary houses , eight families were evacuated from their homes after a five - year rat infestation , which caused major damage to homes as rats burrowed through walls the plague of rats terrorised families by working their way behind walls and setting up home ( inside of rat hole pictured ) , before gnawing through into kitchen cupboards eight homes on the @entity13 ( pictured ) , in @entity14 , @entity15 , were infested with rats for up to five years mother of two @entity34 , 22 , said the vermin infested every part of her home and could be heard scurrying through the walls			1
she saw them at the back of kitchen cupboards and said that she lost hundreds of pounds worth of food to the rodents			1
miss @entity34 and her neighbour even lost running water to the property after the rats gnawed through her pipes			1
she said : ' in the last year and a half it has got to the point where they have been in every nook and cranny of my house			2
' i had no water at one point , no working smoke alarms and it got to the stage that my electrics were going out every 20 minutes because they had chewed through the wires			1
' i did n't feel safe , my children were terrified and it was dangerous and completely unsanitary			1
the rats caused major damage to the homes , including cutting off water and electricity by chewing through pipes and wires after a five - year battle , the housing association which owns the homes has agreed to re-home the families affected while they carry out repairs caused by the rodents ' every day there were just more and more and more rats , you should n't have to get accustomed to seeing rats in your home but i did - and that 's awful			1
' my children could hear them in the walls at night - fighting , squeaking , moving around - and they were terrified			1
' i have a 22 - month - old baby			1
i 've had to bring him up in that home because i 've had no choice			0
' the terrified mother said she first spotted rats in her home , owned by @entity94 , in 2009 , just months after she first moved in with her fiance @entity95 and their now six - year - old son @entity96			1
despite complaining to @entity94 , she claims the association told her pest control was her responsibility			2
miss @entity34 said : ' the rats bit through plumbing pipes , and every time i flushed my toilet , it leaked through the ceiling			2
' they ate through water pipes and i could n't use the washing machine and the dishwasher any more			1
there was a problem with my lights - they kept tripping all the time			0
' we called @entity94 and they sent a contractor out to carry out some repairs			0
they refused to set foot in the house because of the infestation			0
' the electricians that looked at our lights got straight on the phone to the association and told them the houses were n't safe , that they needed to get us all out of there immediately			2
' but it was still almost two weeks before they found us somewhere else to live			0
' ' we 've been treated like idiots			0
it should never have been allowed to get like this			0
' a mother living in one of the infested homes described her family 's living situation as ' dangerous and completely unsanitary ' @entity94 have since re-homed the eight families affected , who have been told that they do not have to move back in once repairs have been made			1
the @entity141 also discovered a ditch used by @entity143 as an overflow for raw sewage less than two metres from one of the families ' homes			2
ammonia levels in the ditch have been linked to three of the residents who lived nearby contracting pneumonia - one of which was @entity34 's son @entity153			0
@entity154 , from @entity94 , said : ' we are so sorry that residents ended up in such circumstances			0
' as soon as we realised the extent of the problem at @entity160 , in september this year , we worked with the residents of the eight affected properties to find them immediate and suitable alternative housing			2
' we moved people out so that we could carry out deep and effective rat treatment to eradicate the problem			0
' we have given all the residents the choice not to return to the @entity13			0
' we are sure these houses can be kept free of pests now and we are working with the responsible authorities to ensure they are doing what they need to do to prevent the problem recurring as well			0
' like all landlords , we give residents advice on the treatment of pests , so they are equipped to deal with most issues that may arise			0
in this instance , the pests got too much for the usual domestic treatments which we advise residents to use			0
