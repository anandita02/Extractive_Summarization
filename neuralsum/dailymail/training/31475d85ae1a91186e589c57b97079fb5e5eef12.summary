inmates at a jail for teenagers represent 48 different gangs , inspectors have discovered , fuelling a ' constant juggling ' by prison officers to keep the boys apart			2
there were high levels of ' unpredictable and reckless ' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , a significant amount of which was gang - related , @entity17 ( @entity17 ) said in a report			1
around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the @entity22 area - were placed on so - called ' keep apart ' lists to tackle gang - related violence , inspectors said			1
there were high levels of ' unpredictable and reckless ' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at @entity13 , a significant amount of which was gang - related , @entity24 's @entity17 said in a report ( file photo ) the number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous @entity17 inspection , but remained ' too high ' with 262 incidents in the six months before the visit , including 79 assaults on staff			1
some incidents were deemed ' very serious ' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a ' very determined way '			1
@entity48 is divided into two sites , with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site a , separated from 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site @entity54 chief inspector of prisons @entity55 said : ' the welcome reduction in the number of boys in custody means that those who remain are a more concentrated mix of very troubled boys who sometimes display very challenging and violent behaviour			1
' as at other @entity65 for this age group , staff in @entity68 still struggled to manage this behaviour in a safe and secure way			0
' staff need more help to do this and i repeat my call for the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) to initiate an independent expert review of its policies and resources for managing behaviour , reducing bullying and supporting victims across all @entity65			0
' use of force had increased dramatically at the site for boys , inspectors found , although supervision of , and accountability for , use of force was deemed good			1
around a quarter of boys spent 23 hours a day locked up in their cell , which critics said amounted to solitary confinement			1
around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the @entity22 area - were placed on so - called ' keep apart ' lists to tackle gang - related violence , inspectors said			1
the number of fights and assaults has reduced since the last @entity17 inspection ( file photo ) the report calls for ' new thinking ' about how to tackle the ' debilitating and seemingly intractable ' problem of gangs , violence and anti-social behaviour among young people			1
the site for young adults still faces significant challenges , inspectors said , particularly a high level of staff vacancies			0
however , the report did flag significant progress at site b , with a drop in fights and assaults and a decrease in use of batons against inmates			1
during the inspection , eight foreign national prisoners were being held beyond the end of their sentence - including one who had been inside for two years after the end of his sentence			0
inspectors labelled this delay ' completely unacceptable '			0
@entity138 , director of campaigns at the @entity140 , said : ' one in four boys in @entity48 prison is spending 23 hours a day locked up in his cell in conditions which amount to solitary confinement			1
' despite some improvements , violence is endemic , including 79 assaults on staff in six months			2
it is particularly concerning that the use of force on children has increased dramatically since the last inspection			0
use of force has increased dramatically at the site for boys , inspectors found , although supervision of , and accountability for , use of force was deemed good ( file photo ) ' however , the problems outlined in this report are not confined to @entity48 - they mirror the findings of a series of inspections conducted across the country in recent months			2
' staff are rightly praised by the inspectorate , but they are working in challenging environments where they are being asked to achieve the impossible			0
' it is high time we stopped locking up children in large , violent institutions and invest instead in what works in rehabilitating children whilst keeping them safe			2
' a previous inspection of site b in march 2013 called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run			2
inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted			0
@entity190 , chief executive of the @entity191 ( @entity191 ) , said : ' as this report makes clear the challenge faced by the governor and staff at @entity48 should not be underestimated			0
' many of the young people in their care have strong gang affiliations and a history of violence			2
' managing their behaviour and supporting them to change and turn their lives around is a difficult and complex task			0
in this context the improvements achieved over the last 12 months are particularly impressive and the governor and his staff deserve huge credit for what has been achieved			0
' there is no easy answer to the challenges presented by the young men in @entity48 but we are committed to working positively with our partners in the @entity76 and in the wider community to reduce violence , prevent victims and support effective rehabilitation			0
