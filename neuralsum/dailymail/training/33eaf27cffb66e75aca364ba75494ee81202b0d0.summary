@entity0 felt the sort of guilt familiar to most working mothers when she left her daughter at a playscheme for much of last year ’s school summer holidays			0
but it was only when she took @entity9 , ten , for a sight test in september that she realised how right she had been to worry			2
for after spending several hours a day on computer games , @entity9 ’s vision had deteriorated rapidly over the summer months			1
‘ i asked her optician if he thought it was because @entity9 had spent so much time on computers while i was working and he said that the increase in her prescription had been so rapid that he could n’t imagine what else could have caused it , ’ recalls @entity0			1
‘ he recommended limiting her access to screens to slow the decline			0
‘ there were plenty of other things @entity9 could have done at the playscheme but , given the choice , like a lot of children , she would always opt for computer games			1
’ the draw of the computer screen is familiar to parents everywhere , but few of us are aware of the physical toll they are taking on our children ’s eyes			1
‘ i felt terribly guilty thinking that i could have prevented the deterioration in @entity9 ’s sight , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ while she has worn glasses since she was eight , she now has a prescription of -4.75 , more than two whole points worse than it was before last summer			1
she really struggles to see without her glasses			0
’ gaming fan : @entity49 , five , was prescribed glasses aged just three and little @entity9 ’s not alone			1
opticians in @entity52 are reporting an increase in the number of young children they see who are myopic — or short - sighted — and are putting it down to the amount of time youngsters now spend staring at @entity61 , laptops and smartphones , instead of playing outdoors as previous generations did			1
while the majority of diagnoses of myopia in children used to happen around puberty , increasing numbers are needing glasses younger and younger			2
and it ’s children from comfortable backgrounds who are driving this increase			2
why ? in part , because they are wealthy enough to have access to all those seductive screens and gadgets , says @entity82 , a consultant in paediatrics at @entity85 ’s @entity84			2
‘ we are seeing a general trend towards myopia , ’ she says			0
‘ and studies suggest that children from better socio - economic backgrounds are more likely to be affected			1
‘ it ’s also much more common in cities			0
one of the theories is that children who play outside are less likely to have myopia			0
outside you have more cause to look into the distance than inside , where you ’re more likely to be doing close - up activities involving reading , writing and screens			2
’ laser eye surgeon @entity104 of @entity106 has called the condition ‘ screen - sightedness ’			1
‘ when myopia or short - sightedness occurs , the eyeball grows from front to back , and becomes egg - shaped instead of round , ’ says mr @entity104			1
‘ we think this is down in part to genetics , but also because of environmental factors			0
‘ in other words , if someone with the genes for myopia was spending lots of time outdoors and not looking at a screen , they might never develop myopia at all			0
’ experts say children may be particularly vulnerable to this because their eyes are still developing			1
screen addict : @entity49 spends up to four hours a day playing on his @entity130 , as well as smartphone games ‘ there are a number of factors involved in the increase of myopia , but i have no doubt that the early use of handheld computers play a big role , ’ says dr @entity132 , head of the new @entity133 at the @entity134 , @entity135			1
she explains that if the eyes do a lot of close - up work while they are still developing , they will interpret nearsightedness as ‘ the normal state ’ and be less efficient at looking at long distances			2
back in @entity153 , @entity9 ’s mum @entity0 , 47 , does n’t allow her daughter to play on the streets outside their home unsupervised			2
‘ i always played out growing up , but it just does n’t feel safe to allow my daughter to do that			0
but i ’ve now set our desktop computer so that the internet cuts out after half an hour			0
it ’s not a foolproof system as she can log back in if i ’m not around to stop her , and it ’s very easy as a busy , working parent to lose track of time			0
‘ as well as the computer , she loves playing games on her @entity173 and my @entity175 phone and can easily notch up three or four hours a day glued to a screen , more at weekends			0
i think these games provide the kind of stimulation that @entity9 ’s brain needs			2
she is a very intelligent child , with a reading age of 15 or 16 , who also gets through a book every couple of days			0
’ miss @entity82 advises parents to encourage their children to do activities involving looking into the distance , such as ball games , running and other sports			2
and she has a warning for those parents whose children have already been diagnosed with short - sightedness : it is likely to keep getting worse			1
she explains : ‘ if you ’re short - sighted , it means your eyeball is bigger than average and , if this happens when you ’re very young , as you keep growing your eyeball keeps growing so you ’re likely to end up significantly short - sighted			1
’ this is a big concern for @entity203 , 39 , and husband @entity204 , 41 , whose son , @entity49 , has been playing games on his siblings ’ phones since he was just two years old			0
@entity49 was diagnosed as short - sighted at the age of three			1
aged five , he already measures -4.75 in his right eye and -5.25 in his left			0
he spends up to four hours a day playing on his @entity130 , as well as games on his older sister ’s smartphone			0
he has six older siblings , three from each of his parents ’ previous marriages , who are aged 11 to 18 , and @entity204 says that gaming has helped bridge the age gap between them			2
young gamer : @entity49 has been playing games on his siblings ' phones since he was two ‘ as a parent , it ’s the easiest thing in the world to leave children playing games while you get on with other things , ’ says @entity204 , a security officer from @entity229 , @entity230			2
‘ but neither my wife and i , nor any of our older children , wears glasses , and if someone could tell me categorically that @entity49 is short - sighted because he was introduced to screens at the age of two and spends too much time on them , i would feel very guilty			1
‘ i do n’t want to believe it , but perhaps i ’m just shielding myself from the unpalatable truth			0
‘ i think it ’s important that he learns to manipulate a mouse and operate a computer			0
if i ’m honest , i think short - sightedness is a price worth paying for that , ’ says @entity204			1
a fifth of children under the age of 13 have never had a sight test , although they are free on the @entity260 , so the problem could be even more widespread than opticians realise			0
@entity263 , a trained optometrist , was upset when her son , @entity264 , was prescribed glasses for short - sightedness aged just six			1
obsessed : @entity267 , eight , loves playing on his @entity173 , and was prescribed glasses aged six now aged eight , @entity264 is the only one of @entity263 ’s three children who is drawn , magnet - like , to electronic games — and the only one who needs spectacles			1
‘ he is obsessed with playing on the @entity61 , @entity130 and @entity173 , ’ says @entity263			0
‘ and it ’s very hard to get him off once he ’s started			0
given free rein , he would be on it for 12 hours a day			0
’ at home in @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , 43 , and husband @entity104 , 45 , a civil servant , try to limit @entity264 ’s screen access to a couple of hours a day at weekends and an hour during the week , but admit that it can creep up			0
‘ i ’ve worn spectacles since the age of 11 and i do wonder , if we had banned all computing , would @entity264 have needed glasses later and would his short - sightedness be less severe ? ’ says @entity263			1
‘ i admit that there might be a link between @entity264 ’s computer gaming and his early short - sightedness			1
one thing i ’m glad of is that children can get contact lenses from 11 — as i know from experience , it can be very hard being a teenager with glasses			1
’ aged ten , @entity9 is already so self - conscious about her spectacles that she has persuaded mum , @entity0 , to explore the possibility of getting contact lenses			1
‘ she has been teased about her glasses and when she ’s picking a new frame it ’s always with a view to what other children might say about them , ’ says @entity0			0
‘ she once had a bright red pair , which attracted a lot of attention , and no longer wants anything so noticeable			0
’ however , if the growing addiction to gaming and trend towards short - sightedness continues , it will soon be the children without glasses who stand out from the crowd .			1

@entity52 opticians are reporting an increase in short - sighted youngsters , *due* to the amount of time spent staring at screens
children from wealthier families are most affected as they own more gadgets
because their eyes are still developing , children are particularly vulnerable to the *damaging* effects of computer screens
gaming fan @entity49 , was prescribed glasses for short - sightedness aged three
@entity9 , aged 10 , has worn glasses since she was eight , and is now *begging* her parents for contact lenses to avoid *bullying*
