climbing the ladder : couples are unable to move into a bigger second home because of rising prices growing numbers of homeowners are ‘ trapped ’ in small first homes as they struggle to take the second step up the property ladder			1
thousands who bought their first home at the peak of the market ca n’t afford to up - size , say experts			1
a study by @entity15 found homeowners must now raise almost £ 60,000 to take their next step			1
the report showed the average household looking to move estimated their current home was worth £ 223,600 – but the price for the next house they wanted was £ 282,000			1
it means these ‘ second steppers ’ must find an extra £ 58,400 to move house – double the amount of the average first - time buyer deposit of £ 25,848 – showing it is more expensive to move up the ladder than to get on it			1
a third said stamp duty was a key challenge in moving house			0
the government has faced fierce criticism for failing to raise stamp duty tax thresholds in line with soaring house prices			0
buyers must now pay more than £ 8,000 in stamp duty on an average @entity42 property worth £ 274,000 , or more than £ 20,000 on an average @entity44 home at £ 514,000			1
the report warns : ‘ second steppers are living in the homes that the first time buyers need to buy to keep the market moving			1
‘ without movement from @entity51 , movement on the ladder comes to a standstill on the second rung			1
’ the gap is £ 15,000 more than last year as house prices , especially sought - after detached homes , soar out of reach			1
many first - time buyers who bought their first home during the 2007 - 08 property surge have only recently come out of negative equity and now face a desperate struggle to raise the extra capital to move into a larger home			1
almost half of those questioned by @entity15 said costs and fees associated with moving house was the biggest barrier to moving up the ladder			1
@entity74 , of the @entity75 , said : ‘ second - steppers are being dealt with multiple blows – those who bought at the last peak with a small deposit may not have seen their equity grow , so may still be pushing to their borrowing to the maximum			1
many people look to move on from their first home after six or seven years , so those who bought in 2007 - 08 at the last peak will now be trying to move			2
the report warns : ‘ second steppers are living in homes the first time buyers need to keep the market moving ' ‘ but homeowners also face the prohibitive cost of moving , made worse by massive stamp duty bills			1
‘ they would have to pay £ 9,000 on a £ 300,000 property , for example			2
‘ this is also against the backdrop of not building enough new houses for years and years , which has pushed up prices beyond many people ’s reach			0
’ mrs @entity74 added that others were struggling to pass new tougher mortgage tests , which meant they were stuck in their first home			2
under the @entity103 introduced in april , lenders must ask probing questions about borrowers ’ spending habits to determine whether they can afford the repayments in the event of interest rate rises			0
housing minister @entity110 : ‘ there are clear benefits to helping second steppers move up ' she said : ‘ the @entity103 has n’t helped second - steppers , who are often young families , in that the affordability tests now take into account sky high childcare costs			2
’ the struggle to up - size has left many people raising families in cramped flats and terraced houses , or forced to turn to government initiatives			2
official figures show rising numbers of second steppers have turned to the government ’s help to buy scheme – originally intended for first - time buyers			1
‘ home - movers ’ using the ‘ equity loan ’ initiative soared from eight per cent to 15 per cent of all people in the last year , while the rest were first - time buyers			1
under the equity loan scheme launched in 2013 , buyers can purchase a new - build property worth up to £ 600,000 with a small deposit			1
also known as help to buy 1 , in return for a five per cent deposit , the government will lend them up to 20 per cent through an interest free loan			2
this allows them to gain mortgage for the remaining 75 per cent of the house			0
after five years , the loan is charged at an interest rate of 1.75 per cent , which rises every year by one per cent , plus inflation			0
housing minister @entity110 said : ‘ whilst first - time buyers make up the overwhelming majority of sales , there are also clear benefits to helping second steppers and other home owners move up the housing ladder , in turn freeing up starter homes for first time buyers to purchase			1
’ @entity165 , a director at mortgage broker @entity166 , said : ‘ borrowers who are paying their current mortgages without any issue are unable to take the next step up the ladder because of new affordability rules			2
‘ as a result there are more families living in their pre-family home who are having to look at moving further away from their places of work to obtain the space they need at a price they can afford			0
’ according to government figures , in june this year 15 per cent of the total 27,167 equity loans approved since its launch were to home - movers			2
this compares to september last year , when they made up just eight per cent of the 5,375 loans which had been processed at the time			2
affordability tests and other new mortgage requirements have made it increasingly difficult for homeowners to borrow the extra money they need to up - size			1
which is why securing the right mortgage is more important than ever before to ensure buying a home is as affordable as possible			0
