by @entity0 published : 12:33 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 16:02 est , 14 march 2014 an extraordinary collection of aerial photographs of @entity5 trenches has come to light nearly a century after the conflict			1
the images were collected by sergeant @entity9 , who served in @entity10 and helped to draw up maps of the battlefield on behalf of the @entity14 forces			1
they show how the trenches snaked across the countryside , which was pock - marked with hundreds of shell craters from the bombardment of the two sides			1
the photographs form part of a scrapbook compiled by @entity24 during the war , which also includes the telegram announcing the end of the conflict and a signed portrait of @entity30			1
the book does not provide details of where and when the pictures were taken or of @entity24 service			1
he appears to have been a royal engineer ( @entity37 )			1
@entity38 were responsible for using balloons and aeroplanes to carry out reconnaissance missions above the trenches - the planes being flown by pilots from @entity47 air units , and when it was formed , the @entity43			1
the missions were fraught with danger and technical difficulty			1
as well as being targets for the @entity52 who would fire from the ground and attack from the air , taking pictures involved holding the camera firmly and hoping that the exposure was quick enough not to be shaken			1
photographs had to have sufficient resolution to be of use to @entity64 gunnery crews on the ground , meaning that plate glass film was initially used			1
as technology advanced , lighter cameras were brought in , but compared to modern technology , they were still large , heavy and difficult to use			1
one of the documents on auction along with sgt @entity9 ' collection of pictures names a ' topo ' - ' topography ' unit , suggesting that he was part of one			1
these units were responsible for plotting where @entity81 batteries would be sited , and were part of the @entity83 , which produced reports which allowed @entity64 intelligence officers to plot both where to site their batteries , and where enemy guns were positioned			1
as the war progressed , more and more men were involved technology advanced , and the scale of the @entity37 's operation expanded , so that by july 1918 , the companies were upgraded to battalions			1
artillery had become the deadliest killer in the trenches rapidly and dominated the war , meaning that assessing the impact of shells on the enemy , the accuracy of aim , and the location of enemy positions was crucial			1
it is unclear if @entity108 flew himself or acquired the pictures in the course of his work			1
the book is going up for auction next month and is expected to fetch around £ 2,500			1
there is very little evidence of shell damage , suggesting that these are newly entrenched areas - which could either by the start of the war , or more likely towards the very end when movement had resumed			1
they could also be training trenches , although their scale makes that unlikely			1
on the left of the picture , the trenches have a regular pattern but angular sections jutting out			1
this was intended to allow for sniper fire to protect against an incursion from @entity144			1
across the top of the picture is a lengthy communications trench , which zig - zags to make sniper fire more difficult , and also to make it more difficult for artillery fire to rake it			1
it connects to other what are more likely to be front line trenches , which are in two rows running from top to bottom of the picture			1
the trenches are dug in a pattern lik damage : this photograph shows how the countryside was covered in shell craters from the aerial bombardment campaign carried out by both sides			1
the picture is one of the few which has information on it , dated 24 june 1917 top right corner			1
the date is shortly after the @entity170 had been launched			1
it is not known if this is in that area , but the scale of damage suggests a heavy @entity176 remains of the roads which covered the area can still be seen			2
close - up : it is hard to grasp the scale of trench warfare , but each section of the zig zag would have been between five and ten feet long			2
@entity185 were protective : if an enemy party managed to enter the trench , they could not fire down its length , and a soldier could defend the corner as long as ammunition - or more primitive weapons - held out			2
but the number of shell hols shows the constant danger soldiers were under			2
it also suggests the area is the very front line - the commucations trenches curve back from it towards the left of the photograph , but do not appear to project much further			2
some short trenches extend beyond the apparent front line , which seems to run from top to bottom			2
they may be the remains of older workings			2
intricate : this photograph is dated 18 march 1918			2
at the time both sides were experiencing something of a calm period - but only for a few more days			2
on 21 march , the @entity52 launched their @entity211			2
fortified in numbers thanks to @entity214 being out of the war , and using newly developed tactics of stormtroopers moving rapidly , they broke through the @entity123 positions , overran the trenches , and opened a war of movement			2
in the end , however , the @entity211 was seen by many historians as the @entity52 ' undoing as the country did not have the resources to support the newly mobile armies , and their supply chains suffered			2
this photograph shows how trneches were built with forward - projecting sections like the tops of medieval battlements , and also built in rows			2
the presence of the corner at the top centre of the picture suggests some form of change of direction in the trenches , possibly due to change in the topography - the section here is built on flat ground			2
this picture is one of the few with specific geographical details			0
it appears to be taken in the air above @entity52 positions near @entity252 , in the @entity253 , and @entity255 , in the @entity254			0
at the top left is an arrow pointing towards the @entity258 , which is around three miles south - west of @entity255			0
to the right is the village of @entity262 , which is just outside @entity252			0
in the front is the @entity264 , a @entity52 defensive system which ran south from @entity255			0
it was built in the winter of 1916 and 1917 and designed to hold off an expected offensive which the @entity52 believed would happen in the summer of 1917			0
the @entity269 in fact largely held and although the @entity52 lost land in front of it ( in this picture the fields in the foreground ) it appeared to prevent a larger breakthrough by the @entity123			0
the photograph is date 17 august 1917 , by which time @entity81 offensives in the area had largely ended following the second battle of @entity282			0
however there were further offensives after this photograph and in november 1917 @entity262 was taken by the 62nd ( @entity286 ) division on 20 and 21 november 1917			0
@entity262 remained in @entity14 hands until the following 6 december			0
it was recaptured on 27 september 1918 , by the 57th ( @entity290 ) and 63rd ( @entity291 ) divisions , acting with the 52nd ( @entity293 ) and the 1st and 4th @entity295 divisions			0
it is today home to a @entity299 cemetery , with the majority of soldier buried there from the @entity295 army			0
this photograph has no geography or date , and shows both trenches and what appear to be heavy gun emplacements ( top centre )			0
the lack of shell damage and the small number of trenches suggests this is behind the front lines , where heavy guns would be emplaced			0
it is impossible to tell if it was a photograph taken to show @entity52 positions or @entity81 ones			0
the @entity37 photographed both to allow @entity64 intelligence officers to have a complete picture of the battlefield - meaning risky aerial missions with cumbersome cameras			0
another undated image suggests positions behind the front lines , as the heaviest shell damage is concentrated at the bottom left			0
lengthy communication trenches were needed to bring forward supplies , and although @entity5 was not a war of movement , the shifting positions of the fronts meant that not all were used all the time			0
roads remained crucial - the white chalk road is typical of the north of @entity10 or @entity340 , while the fields seem unused			0
it is unclear what the dark sections along the centre represent - it could be something printed on to the pictures to show planned fortifications , or the beginnings of works on the ground			0
the sheer scale of bombardment , together with the trenches on the right , suggests that this is a section which has recently been the subject of action			0
the trenches on the right are a front line , although the lack of clear information means whose - and where - is not known			0
the pictures are marked ( top left ) with coding which would allow the @entity37 and @entity64 to assemble an overview of the battlefield			0
the pictures also show how roads - and in this case what may be the canal of the @entity253 , running from centre left to bottom right - survived bombardment , at the top of the photograph , however , the intense bombardment means the chalk underneath the topsoil is all that can be seen			0
artillery units wanted to rain shells down on trenches , not elsewhere , but accuracy was limited			0
@entity384 became the main weapon of the war and each side became evenly matched in their ability to produce weapons and ammunition			0
historic : another object in the scrapbook is the telegram announcing the @entity395 and the end of the @entity5			1
the underlining of ' @entity398 ' suggests that it was sent to the topographic section of a @entity400 , which appears to be where @entity108 served			0
the signal was sent from the headquarters of the @entity47 , which in november 1918 was under the command of general sir @entity404 ( later @entity406 ) @entity405			0
collector : the objects brought together by @entity24 are expected to fetch around £ 2,500 when they go up for auction next week			1

photographs were collected by sergeant @entity9 in a scrapbook which is now going up for auction
