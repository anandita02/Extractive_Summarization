more than 6,000 new recruits have joined @entity2 since @entity3 started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month , it has been claimed			1
of those radical @entity6 flocking to @entity2 ' ranks , at least 1,300 are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast swaths of @entity10 and @entity11 currently under the group 's control , according to analysts from the @entity16 - based @entity15			1
news of the surge in numbers comes as @entity20 said it would no longer refer to the group as @entity2 or the @entity22 , and would instead be calling them by the derogatory title ' @entity26 cutthroats '			1
@entity2 , which has been condemned as barbaric even by notorious terror group @entity27 , rebranded as @entity22 earlier this year after declaring the formation of a caliphate in @entity11 and @entity10			1
a number of rebel commanders who oppose @entity2 but also fight against their enemy @entity10 president @entity42 have warned that the strikes are increasing local support for the terrorists			1
as well as aggressive social media - led recruitment campaigns in the @entity35 , @entity2 has released a number of slick @entity51 - language propaganda videos and digital magazines designed to encourage young @entity6 living in @entity54 nations to join the terror group			1
@entity2 aims to convince impressionable young @entity56 that its brutal interpretation of @entity6 is how @entity58 intended believers to live and that all those who oppose the group can justifiably be murdered			1
the vast majority of the 1,300 foreign fighters who have signed up to join @entity2 in the past month are aged between 15 and 20 - years - old and have never been involved in a conflict before , according to @entity64 - a spokesman for the @entity65 , part of the @entity68 rebel group			1
@entity2 receives approximately 20 new recruits a day in the town of north - west @entity10 town @entity71 alone , he told @entity72			1
many of these jihadists are thought to have easily entered @entity10 across the porous border with @entity76 , having arrived in the latter country on budget airline flights to popular tourist airport @entity79			1
change : @entity20 foreign minister @entity81 said the country will no longer refer to @entity2 as the @entity22 and would now be using the derogatory title ' @entity84 @entity83 anger : @entity87 president @entity86 ( right ) has denounced @entity2 ' beheading of innocent people , saying the shameful actions of the militant group ( led by @entity92 , left ) violate @entity68 principles rebels fighting against president @entity42 in northwestern @entity10 are suspected of sabotaging a batch of measles vaccination - leading to the deaths of 50 young children			1
dozens of infants in the rebel - held cities of @entity103 and @entity104 in @entity106 province died on tuesday , minutes after being given the drug			2
although the cause of death has not yet been established , officials reportedly suspect the vaccines may have been tampered with while unguarded in a storage facility in the city of @entity103			0
the vaccinations are part of a large - scale campaign to stop the spread of measles , mumps , rubella , and polio in rebel - held areas of northern @entity10			1
they are being distributed by volunteer medical and aid organisations operating in the area , according to the @entity128			0
in a @entity132 interview with the newspaper , dr @entity129 - a physician who helped administer the vaccine - said the drugs had been delivered to the medical centre three days before being given to the children			2
' this is the first time we have had such a problem , ' he added			0
mr @entity129 proposed an alternative theory for the deaths - the vaccines were stored at too high a temperature			2
most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges , ' he said			0
samples of the leftover drug have now been sent to @entity76 for analysis			0
it is not yet known how long it will be before the results of the investigation are released			0
how to refer to @entity2 has been a source of much debate in the @entity155 - not least because the militant group has continually renamed itself			2
formed as @entity158 ( meaning @entity159 ) in 1999 , the militants changed name to @entity162 fi @entity161 ( meaning @entity163 in the @entity164 ) in 2003			2
as it became better known , @entity54 countries began referring to the group as @entity27 in @entity11 , also known as @entity2			1
in 2006 the group became part of an umbrella organization called the @entity171 before re-branding as @entity172 ( the @entity2 , or @entity2 ) later the same year			2
last year , having expanded into @entity10 , the group changed its name to the @entity2 ( @entity2 )			1
an alternative name for the @entity176 is ' @entity177 ' which led to the alternative name @entity2 ( @entity2 )			0
the derogatory @entity180 acronym @entity26 - the name @entity20 now says it will now refer to @entity2 by - is based on the @entity183 version of this name : @entity177			1
earlier this year the group claimed to have established a caliphate in the @entity35 , and dropped all geographic references in its name - simply calling itself the @entity22			2
referring to the group by this name has proven problematic as the group is neither a recognised independent state , nor does it represent the views of the majority of @entity6			1
a total of 20 new recruits a day equates to 500 jihadists turning up in @entity71 every month - with mr @entity64 saying there are ' hundreds ' of other towns in @entity10 seeing a similar level of arrival			1
the group pay wages of up to £ 600 a month to seasoned fighters from areas like @entity205 and @entity206 , and even greater sums to professional workers such as doctors and surgeons , according to @entity211 , a spokesman for the @entity212			2
@entity213 and @entity214 yesterday launched an unprecedented plea for its affiliate in @entity10 , @entity217 , to stop fighting against @entity2 and unite against a @entity3 led ' alliance of infidelity and evil			2
' the development came as @entity20 said it would no longer refer to @entity2 as the @entity22 and would now be using the derogatory title ' @entity26 cutthroats '			2
foreign minister @entity81 asked journalists and media organisations to comply with the request , arguing ' this is a terrorist group and not a state ' , and saying any other title unfairly blurs the line between ordinary @entity6 and extremists			1
@entity233 : as well as aggressive social media - led recruitment campaigns in the @entity35 , @entity2 has released a number of slick @entity51 propaganda videos ( such as the one pictured above ) and digital magazines designed to encourage young @entity6 living in @entity54 nations to join the terror group spread : nine imams were among 15 people arrested by masked police ( pictured ) in @entity244 yesterday			1
the arrests were allegedly to stop the flow of young @entity6 leaving the country to join @entity2 the name @entity26 is taken from the loose acronym @entity180 nations use to abbreviate their name for the @entity252			1
@entity2 has condemned the acronym @entity26 as insulting and disrespectful because it sounds like the @entity183 words ' daes ' - which means ' one who crushes something underfoot ' , and ' dahes ' - which means ' one who sows discord '			2
the word ' dahes ' also has negative connotations to turbulent @entity267 era of infighting between @entity270 tribes - a period of history that has come to be known as @entity273			0
this morning @entity87 president @entity86 denounced @entity2 ' beheading of innocent people , saying the militant group 's shameful actions violate @entity68 principles			0
' from the viewpoint of the @entity68 tenets and culture , killing ... innocent people equals the killing of the whole humanity , ' @entity86 told @entity3 television network @entity284			0
' and therefore , the killing and beheading of innocent people in fact is a matter of shame for them and it 's the matter of concern and sorrow for all the human and all the mankind , ' he added			0
the 22 - year - old @entity298 man arrested in @entity300 's largest counterterrorism operation allegedly conspired with @entity300 's most senior @entity302 militant to launch a deadly attack on a random passerby , court documents show			0
according to the documents , police intercepted a phone call between the arrested @entity308 and @entity309 - who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 @entity300 fighting in the @entity35 - two days ago			0
the account said @entity309 ordered him to carry out an attack which @entity315 heard was ' clearly designed to shock , horror and terrify the community '			0
@entity308 appeared in @entity298 's @entity315 charged with conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on @entity300 soil before it emerged this month that @entity322 had become a senior @entity22 militant , he worked as a bouncer in @entity298 's @entity326 nightclub district and had also played a bit part in the tv series @entity329			0
@entity308 today appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on @entity300 soil			0
he is the only man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in raids earlier today			0
police prosecutor @entity336 told the court that @entity308 had made a threat during a phone call a few days ago which involved a ' random selection of persons to execute '			0
police intercepted a phone call between the arrested @entity308 and @entity309 ( pictured ) who worked as a bouncer at a @entity326 nightclub and played a bit part in an episode of @entity329 @entity308 , who has dark hair , a beard and moustache , had displayed ' an unusual level of fanaticism ' in the call , which was intercepted by police			0
@entity308 's lawyer @entity352 did not apply for bail but asked magistrate @entity354 if @entity308 could go back down to the dock during the hearing			0
magistrate @entity354 agreed and @entity308 , who had sat in the dock stroking his beard and smiled briefly while talking to mr @entity352 , left the courtroom .			0
