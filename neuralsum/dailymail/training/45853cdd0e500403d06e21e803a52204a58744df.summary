the world ’s carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control			0
scientists from the @entity7 have warned that emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels			1
other greenhouse gases , such as methane , nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons ( @entity18 ) , need to follow suit so that , overall , greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero between 2080 and 2100			1
scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels ( pictured ) , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels a certain level of carbon is emitted naturally , but the report refers to reducing man - made emission to zero - referred to as net zero			1
the stark report , by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) said that emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century , in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions , such as widespread droughts			1
countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 ° c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but @entity31 said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions will be ‘ way beyond safe limits ’			2
it warned that even if countries meet their existing pledges to cut emissions , the world will exceed the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted to keep temperature rises within safe levels - by 10 billion tonnes by 2020 , and 17 billion tonnes by 2030			2
countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 ° c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected , such as melting ice caps and rising sea levels ( illustrated ) - but @entity31 said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions would be ‘ way beyond safe limits ' to have a good chance of staying below 2 ° c , greenhouse gas emissions should drop by around 15 per cent or more by 2030 , compared to 2010 levels , and be at least 50 per cent lower by 2050 on the way to net zero emissions			1
the report said that there could still be room for some emissions at the end of the century if they are compensated for by measures that take in carbon , such as planting trees , to achieve ‘ carbon neutrality ’			0
but delaying taking stringent action now until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and greater risks to society			1

the @entity101 report is published ahead of @entity7 climate talks in @entity103 , @entity104 , which are working towards a new global deal to tackle climate change that it ’s hoped will be agreed in @entity108 next year			0
@entity31 executive director @entity109 said : ‘ an increase in global temperature is proportional to the build - up of long - lasting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , especially carbon dioxide			2
‘ taking more action now reduces the need for more extreme action later to stay within safe emissions limits			0
’ @entity121 chief executive @entity120 said the report was another stark reminder of the ‘ worrying chasm ’ between what scientists said needed to be done to avoid dangerous climate change and what governments have promised to do so far			0
‘ if we do n’t close this “ emissions gap ” within this decade , our task will not only become harder and more expensive , but threatens the very survival of some of the world ’s most vulnerable communities and habitats , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity137 and delay are our enemies			0
as the report rightly notes , postponing rigorous action until 2020 will lock in much higher costs and risks later on			2
this is an unacceptable legacy to bequeath to our descendants			0
‘ we must end the era of dirty fossil fuels and move to an era of clean renewable energy as fast as possible			0
‘ we can not ignore one of the report ’s key findings , namely , that energy efficiency offers a triple win : emissions reductions , energy security and green jobs			0

scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070
action will stop temperatures rising 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels
greenhouse gases , such as methane and nitrous oxide , need to follow suit
@entity31 report says emissions must peak by 2020
delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life , experts warn
