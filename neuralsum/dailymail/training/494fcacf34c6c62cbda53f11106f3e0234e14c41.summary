by @entity0 a police expert who is trained in identifying suspected criminals from @entity3 believes he may have found the soldier behind one of the most famous photographs of the @entity7			1
last week , @entity8 claimed that his father @entity9 was the man captured on camera carrying a wounded comrade through the trenches during the @entity13 in 1916			1
however , @entity17 ' super-recogniser ' pc @entity14 has ruled @entity18 out of the running , saying he can not be the person from the propaganda film			1
instead , he pointed to @entity23 @entity22 as a possible candidate , as there is a ' link and a resemblance ' between photographs of him and the famous image from the @entity31			1
mystery : the soldier in this image , taken from @entity35 , has never been identified found ? @entity36 believes the soldier was his father , @entity23 @entity22 , pictured in this photograph the picture was taken from @entity35 , a film which helped educate the @entity41 public to the horrors of the trenches at a time when many had a much more positive image of the war			1
it shows a soldier looking up at the camera with a haunted look , carrying a wounded man who is said to have died half an hour after the footage was captured			1
however , the film 's producers did not keep a record of who appeared in it , leading to decades of speculation about the soldier 's identity			2
last week mr @entity8 , 83 , said he had no doubt that the man must have been his father , who survived the trenches and lived until 1960			2
claim : last week the son of @entity66 , pictured with his wife , said he thought he was the soldier but mr @entity14 , one of the @entity69 's most skilled identification experts , told @entity70 it was almost impossible that the two men were the same person			1
' his nose is a lot longer and sharper and the eyes seem different , ' he said			0
' the soldier has a full ear lobe and [ @entity66 ] does n't - he has a squarer chin and slightly higher forehead			2
' solution ? @entity81 @entity14 , pictured , says @entity82 can not have been the soldier and suggests it is more likely to have been @entity85 @entity36 , 83 , from @entity86 , insists that the man was in fact his father @entity23 , who served with the @entity90			1
the former soldier apparently remembered being caught on camera while carrying his comrade towards the nearest medical station			1
when mr @entity14 saw a photograph of @entity85 , he said : ' there is more of a link and a resemblance , if you look at the straight brow , the stronger and broader nose and the solid - looking , oval shape of the face			1
' and he has the right kind of ear lobe			0
i would say there is a link with this one			0
' @entity85 was a miner from @entity111 , before moving to @entity112 to work on building the @entity113			2
during the war he used his mining experience to help dig military tunnels , and he died in 1960 at the age of 76			0
the @entity118 , which owns the propaganda film , says the question of identification is ' officially open ' and has declined to comment on the competing claims			0
mr @entity14 has identified more than 200 criminals from examining @entity3 footage of crime scenes			1
he is part of a team of @entity69 ' super-recognisers ' who have been picked out as exceptionally talented at spotting people and matching up identifications			2
the specialist officers are often used to provide the initial breakthrough in a case , which will then be investigated using conventional means to corroborate the identification of the suspect			0
the @entity13 was shown around @entity41 just four weeks after it was filmed on the battlefield			0
it was a huge success , and 20million people had flocked to cinemas to see the footage just six weeks after it was released			2
a single film would not reach so many viewers again until @entity145 in 1977			0
photographs and descriptions of life on the front had been available previously , but this was the first time a moving picture of modern warfare was widely shown			0
many audience members would never have seen a film before			0
at first was feared that the graphic depiction of war might damage morale , but instead the images of brave @entity41 soldiers struggling on the front line brought about a huge swell of support			0
a newspaper report at the time said : ' crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them , and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents , opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in @entity183			0

soldier caught on camera in the @entity31 in 1916 has never been identified
last week it was claimed that his name was @entity191
but pc @entity14 says it is not possible that the two men are the same
the *constable* - who is an expert in identifying people using photographs - says it is more likely to be @entity23 @entity22 , a former miner
