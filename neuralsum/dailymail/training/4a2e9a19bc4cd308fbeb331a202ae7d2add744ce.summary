by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:23 pm on 16th november 2011 two thirds of foreign wives could be banned from the @entity4 under plans to stop immigrants becoming ' a burden on the state '			1
government immigration advisers say that the minimum salary required to bring a spouse to @entity4 should go up significantly , and may even be doubled			1
the proposals could mean more than half of the @entity4 's population would not be able to bring in a foreign partner , as they might not earn enough to support them without relying on benefits			1
and the threshold may be pushed even higher for those trying to bring children to the @entity4			2
family : but @entity4 residents earning less than the national average wage could be barred from bringing in a partner from abroad ( file photo ) professor @entity27 , chairman of the @entity28 , said a minimum salary of between £ 18,600 and £ 25,700 should be introduced for @entity4 residents sponsoring a partner or dependant for @entity4 citizenship			1
this minimum , which applies equally to @entity4 citizens and immigrants , is currently set at around £ 13,700			2
some 40,000 foreign wives , husbands and partners were granted visas to join their family in the @entity4 last year , but that number would be cut by up to 63 per cent under the proposals			1
the government asked the advisers to identify the salary a worker would need to earn to support a spouse or partner ' without them becoming a burden on the state ' , professor @entity43 said			0
the minimum salary could be even higher for those who wanted their children to join them from abroad , he added			2
the lowest figure in the proposed range , £ 18,600 , is the income level at which many benefits , including housing benefit and tax credits , are withdrawn , while the highest figure , £ 25,700 , represents the typical income of a one - adult household			0
it would mean that between a quarter and a half of full - time adult workers would be unable to bring their partners to the @entity4 - but many others , including the unemployed and pensioners , could be prevented too			1
wealthy : only those earning above - average wages will be able to sponsor a spouse prof @entity43 said the proposals do not take into account @entity4 ' right to a family life			1
' we have to abide by the terms of reference that we are set up for , and that 's to answer the questions which the government sets us , and not go off on a track of our own , ' he said			0
' it 's for others to then decide whether in some senses that question is a bit wrong , [ if ] it 's in this case too economic focused , or quite possibly we 've not addressed it properly			0
' he added that the current threshold was ' a bit low ' , and suggested there was ' justification for raising the pay threshold ' to prevent a huge benefits bill for spouses from abroad			0
the @entity28 's figures show that of the 40,000 spouses and partners brought in from outside the @entity107 , nearly a third were from @entity108 , @entity109 or @entity110 , while 6 per cent came from the @entity111 and 5 per cent from @entity112			2
it added that while 94 per cent of those based in the @entity4 with a spouse abroad wanted their partner to join them , half earned less than £ 20,100 and three quarters earned less than £ 30,500			1
the @entity121 warned that if the government accepted the proposals and went ahead with the policy , ' it is likely to be challenged in the courts '			0
@entity127 , the think - tank 's associate director , said : ' it is n't unreasonable - particularly in the current economic climate - to ask whether , if someone is destitute or entirely dependent on benefits , they should be allowed to bring in a spouse or partner who is likely to end up in a similar position			0
' but introducing an income threshold at £ 25,700 - the level of the national median income - would effectively bar half the population from bringing a spouse or partner from abroad			0
' we 're not talking about people who are destitute or living on benefits , we are talking about people who are working and getting an average wage			0
