by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:15 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 13 february 2013 @entity2 faces a ' living standards crisis ' as it was revealed that millions of families will never regain the losses they sustained during the financial crisis and recession			2
average earnings have sunk to the level they were at 10 years ago as workers are squeezed by a toxic combination of pay freezes and hikes in the cost of living			1
@entity16 today accused @entity17 of presiding over ' falling living standards ' and abandoning the less well - off in favour of the rich			1
long road to recovery : living standards could take years to return to pre-crash levels , the @entity24 has predicted real earnings peaked in 2009 , with the average wage at £ 12.25 per hour , but since then pay increases have been outstripped by inflation , knocking the average back down to where it was in 2003 at £ 11.21 per hour , the @entity27 said			1
and millions of families may never see their finances recover from the impact of the economic downturn , a leading think tank added			2
' we have a flatlining economy and - this will be the question of the next two years - declining living standards as a result , ' mr @entity16 said to @entity17 at @entity47 's questions today			1
' can you just remind us what the thinking was when you decided to provide an average tax cut of £ 100,000 for everyone earning over £ 1million in this country ? ' the @entity55 leader said the government had ' cut tax credits , raised vat and people are worse , not better off '			1
he concluded : ' there is a living standards crisis for the many and all he does is stand up for a few at the top			2
' we have got a failing prime minister , he is out of touch and he stands up for the wrong people			2
' but mr @entity17 insisted he was ' helping working people by taking 24million people and giving them a tax cut this year ' , adding : ' people will be a lot better off than they were under @entity55 , with a record deficit , with unreformed welfare , with a busted banking system			2
' clash : @entity16 challenged @entity17 about the unpromising data at @entity47 's questions today the prime minister also pointed to comments made today by sir @entity81 , outgoing governor of the @entity82 , claiming that a ' recovery is in sight ' for the @entity2 economy			1
the economist continued : ' that is not to say that the road ahead will be smooth			0
this has n’t been a normal recession and it wo n’t be a normal recovery			0
' he warned that inflation would stay high for the foreseeable future as the economy is too weak for measures which would drive it down			0
the @entity24 said it is likely to take as long as 15 years just for living standards to recover to pre-crash levels , meaning that someone who earned £ 22,000 a year in 2008 will have to wait until 2023 to get back to a similar standard of living			0
however , had the downturn not hit , a £ 22,000 income would have reached around £ 27,500 by 2023			0
to reach this level , incomes would have to grow by an almost impossible rate of 3.3 per cent a year , it warned			1
the last time this growth level was seen was in the 1960s			1
far from growing , the @entity111 forecasts that average real earnings will in fact continue to fall into 2014 at the same time as support from tax credits and benefits is due to decline			1
the @entity27 earnings report said male workers in private firms have suffered the biggest decline in earnings since the recession in 2008			1
their average earnings last year were worth less in real terms than in 2002 , the research showed			1
a similar trend was found in the public sector , although the decline was less @entity129 workers in the public sector saw their real earnings decline by an average of 2.1 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012 , compared with 3.1 per cent in private firms , said the @entity27			1
disposable incomes have shrank for those with low to middle incomes , leaving families with less to spend on non-essentials ( source : @entity24 ) chances of a quick recovery looked even more remote today , as a leading business body warned the economy will not grow as quickly this year as previously forecast			1
the @entity144 now expects 1 per cent growth in 2013 , less than its previous estimate of 1.4 per cent , warning the potential for a new ' flare - up ' in eurozone tensions was likely to keep confidence and growth in check			0
but at least the economy is likely to avoid another recession , it added , with 0.3 per cent growth predicted in the first quarter			0
a rise in job vacancies and an improvement in business sentiment hint at marginal growth , it said			0
the resolution report squeezed @entity2 2013 laid bare the ongoing plight of families with low to middle incomes			1
it defined these households as being of working age and relying primarily on their own earned resources but with incomes below the median for the @entity2			0
in practice , it means couples without children living on a joint income of between £ 12,000 and £ 30,000 or between £ 17,000 and £ 41,000 for a couple with two children			0
it revealed the ten million adults in this pay bracket have seen spending power plunge by an average of £ 280 a year since the start of the financial crisis			1
the fall in earnings is blamed on a cut in benefits and tax credits and workers having to cut their hours			1
six out of ten in the middle to low income group are struggling to keep up with bills , with seven per cent behind on at least one bill			1
just over half have no savings at all and two - thirds have less than a month ’s income in savings			0
squeezed incomes mean households with middle to low incomes would now take an average of 22 years to save for a deposit on a first - time buyer property , the report calculated			1
the number of years it would take for a low or middle income family to save for a down payment on their first home has risen to 22 years ( source : @entity24 ) @entity220 , senior economist at the @entity24 , said : ‘ there is a long road to travel just to get back to where living standards stood before the crisis - and the prospects of actually recovering the ground lost over recent years appear vanishingly thin			2
‘ every extra month of falling household incomes is harder to take than the last as household budgets get closer to the edge			0
’ @entity231 , chief executive of the @entity24 , said : ‘ without steady growth in earnings living standards will continue to stagnate			2
we ca n’t just return to the skewed growth of the past when too many on low and middle incomes failed to keep up with overall rises in prosperity			2
’ the think tank ’s findings were echoed by another report released today , which showed 54 per cent of consumers expect their household budget to be tighter this year			0
as many as 42 per cent expect the economy to get worse in the next 12 months , the latest which ? @entity247 found			0
financial resilience has also taken a hit , with 41 per cent already finding it tough to cope with an unexpected expense			0
the survey also found that more than a third ( 35 per cent ) have increased their total level of debt in the past month , while the figures suggested that almost six million households dipped into their savings to cover monthly household spending on items like food and utility bills , seven million cut spending on everyday essentials and four million used credit to pay for food			2
the @entity144 also warned household spending power is set to grow at a more muted pace this year , but as confidence improved the impulse to save would wane			0
director - general @entity271 said : ' we are beginning to see the return of organic growth , with clear signs that firms offering the right products into the right markets are growing sales and expanding			0
recent business surveys also give grounds for cautious optimism about our forward prospects			0
' he added : ' after the uncertainties of 2012 , the fear of external storm clouds lingers			0
