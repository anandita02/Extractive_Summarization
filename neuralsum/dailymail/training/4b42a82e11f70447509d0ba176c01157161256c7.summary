a manager at a ‘ busy @entity2 restaurant ’ claims that customers constantly using their cell phones are to blame for a dramatic increase in the amount of time it takes to be served in restaurants nowadays			1
in an anonymous post on the @entity13 ' rants & raves ' board , the restaurateur claims to have reviewed surveillance videos from 2004 and 2014 and found a staggering difference in the average time it takes to service a customer			1
following their research , the poster found that the average time that a customer spent in the restaurant from start to finish in 2004 was 1 hour and 5 minutes , while in 2014 the average time was 1 hour and 55 minutes			1
an anonymous restaurant manager claims to have reviewed surveillance videos from 2004 and 2014 and found a staggering difference in the average time it takes to serve a customer because they spend so long on their cell phones the restaurant decided to compare the footage in a bid to discover why service is significantly slower compared with ten years ago despite adding staff and cutting back on menu items			1
after comparing the videos , they found that cell phones have become a large distraction for customers which are preventing them from ordering as efficiently as they once did			1
nowadays customers are too per - occupied with taking photos upon entering , telling the waiters they are having problems connecting to the @entity52 , taking photos of their food once it ’s delivered to them and bumping into other customers and waiters as they enter and exit the restaurant as a result of texting while walking			1
restaurant customers nowadays are too preoccupied with taking photos and telling waiters they are having problems connecting to the @entity52 the poster , who lists their age as 28 and location as @entity65 , offers few clues to the name of the restaurant but describes it as popular with both locals and tourists alike			1
‘ we are grateful for everyone who comes into our restaurant , after all there are so many choices out there			0
but can you please be a bit more considerate ? , ’ the poster begs			0
read the full post here ... we are a popular restaurant for both locals and tourists alike			0
having been in business for many years we noticed that although the number of customer ’s we serve on a daily basis is almost the same today as it was 10 years ago , the service just seems super slow even thou we added lot ’s more staff and cut back on the menu items			2
one of the most common complaints on review sites against us and many restaurants in the area is that the service was slow and or they needed to wait a bit long for a table			2
we decided to hire a firm to help us solve this mystery , and naturally the first thing they blamed it on was that the employees need more training and that maybe the kitchen staff is just not up to the task of serving that many customers			2
like most restaurants in @entity2 we have a surveillance system , and unlike today where it ’s a digital system , 10 years ago we still used special high capacity tapes to record all activity			2
at any given time we had 4 special @entity118 systems recording multiple cameras			2
we would store the footage for 90 days just in case we need it for something			0
the restaurant decided to compare the footage in a bid to discover why service is significantly slower compared with ten years ago despite adding staff and cutting back on menu items the firm we hired suggested we locate some of the older tapes and analyze how the staff behaved 10 years ago versus how they behave now			1
we went down to our storage room but we could n’t find any tapes at all			0
we did find the recording devices , and luckily for us , each device has 1 tape in it that we simply never removed when we upgraded to the new digital system			2
the date stamp on the old footage was thursday july 1 2004 , the restaurant was real busy that day			1
we loaded up the footage on a large size monitor , and next to it on a separate monitor loaded up the footage of thursday july 3 2014 , the amount of customers where only a bit more than 10 years prior			1
i will quickly outline the findings			0
we carefully looked at over 45 transactions in order to determine the data below : 2004 : customers walk in			1
they gets seated and are given menus , out of 45 customers 3 request to be seated elsewhere			2
customers on average spend 8 minutes before closing the menu to show they are ready to order			1
@entity162 shows up almost instantly takes the order			0
food starts getting delivered within 6 minutes , obviously the more complex items take way longer			2
out of 45 customers 2 sent items back that where too cold we assume ( given they were not steak we assume they wanted the item heated up more )			2
waiters keep an eye out for their tables so they can respond quickly if the customer needs something			0
customers are done , check delivered , and within 5 minutes they leave			1
average time from start to finish : 1:05 2014 : customers walk in			1
customers get seated and is given menus , out of 45 customers 18 requested to be seated elsewhere			0
before even opening the menu they take their phones out , some are taking photos while others are simply doing something else on their phone ( sorry we have no clue what they are doing and do not monitor customer @entity52 activity )			1
7 out of the 45 customers had waiters come over right away , they showed them something on their phone and spent an average of 5 minutes of the waiter ’s time			1
given this is recent footage , we asked the waiters about this and they explained those customers had a problem connecting to the @entity52 and demanded the waiters try to help them			1
finally the waiters are walking over to the table to see what the customers would like to order			2
the majority have not even opened the menu and ask the waiter to wait a bit			0
customer opens the menu , places their hands holding their phones on top of it and continue doing whatever on their phone			0
waiter returns to see if they are ready to order or have any questions			0
the customer asks for more time			0
finally they are ready to order			0
total average time from when the customer was seated until they placed their order 21 minutes			1
food starts getting delivered within 6 minutes , obviously the more complex items take way longer.26 out of 45 customers spend an average of 3 minutes taking photos of the food			1
14 out of 45 customers take pictures of each other with the food in front of them or as they are eating the food			0
this takes on average another 4 minutes as they must review and sometimes retake the photo			2
9 out of 45 customers sent their food back to reheat			0
obviously if they did n’t pause to do whatever on their phone the food would n’t have gotten cold			0
27 out of 45 customers asked their waiter to take a group photo			0
14 of those requested the waiter retake the photo as they were not pleased with the first photo			0
on average this entire process between the chit chatting and reviewing the photo taken added another 5 minutes and obviously caused the waiter not to be able to take care of other tables he / she was serving			1
given in most cases the customers are constantly busy on their phones it took an average of 20 minutes more from when they were done eating until they requested a check			1
furthermore once the check was delivered it took 15 minutes longer than 10 years ago for them to pay and leave			0
8 out of 45 customers bumped into other customers or in one case a waiter ( texting while walking ) as they were either walking in or out of the restaurant			0
average time from start to finish : 1:55 we are grateful for everyone who comes into our restaurant , after all there are so many choices out there			1
but can you please be a bit more considerate ?			0
