by @entity0 according to the @entity1 , 83 per cent of @entity2 are showing signs of gum disease it does n’t take much to keep your teeth and gums in great shape , yet according to the @entity1 , 83 per cent of @entity2 are showing signs of gum disease			1
so what can you do to ensure your smile stays in style ? most of us are aware of the confidence - boosting benefits of a fabulous foundation , mascara or blush , and we ’re clearly happy to invest both hard - earned cash and precious time on them			2
it ’s a rare woman who can make her way through a department store beauty floor without being tempted by the latest cosmetic colours			2
however , the amount of money we spend on replenishing our make - up bags may surprise you - recent figures estimate that we ’ll each spend an average of £ 131.20 a year on make - up			2
and we spend , on average , around 20 minutes a day applying cosmetics , which equates to over 120 hours every year			0
conduct a quick straw poll around you and you ’ll probably find most of us do n’t dedicate nearly as much time and effort to our oral health			2
invest in your smile so , are you guilty of getting your priorities wrong and leaving the true beauty of your smile at the bottom of the pile ? after all , no amount of on - trend lip colour can mask the signs of poor oral health			1
in fact , not only can symptoms such as red , swollen gums detract from a radiant smile , but if left untreated , gum disease could have devastating consequences such as tooth loss			1
with more than four in five people in the @entity2 showing signs of gum disease , it ’s time we refocused some of our efforts to improve our oral hygiene			1
and of course , it ’s not just women who are guilty of ignoring the telltale symptoms			0
according to a new survey by @entity67 , only 19 per cent of us would visit the dentist if we noticed changes in our gums , compared to 46 per cent who would visit when they have trouble with their teeth			1
and , astonishingly , almost half of all those questioned have never spoken with their dentist about gum health			1
more than four in five people in the @entity2 show signs of gum disease gum disease is the swelling , soreness or infection – in varying degrees - of the tissue supporting the teeth			1
you may have heard of gingivitis , the name given to the early stage of gum disease , caused by an accumulation of plaque , which contains bacteria that needs to be removed in order to maintain healthy gums			1
read the signals the problem is that many of us do n’t recognise the early signs of gum disease : one of the warning signals that you may have gingivitis is redness of the gums around the tooth , and bleeding when you brush your teeth			1
@entity67 found that 41 per cent of readers surveyed had experienced bleeding while brushing or flossing , yet one in three said they believed bleeding gums are the result of brushing too vigorously			1
but , if ignored and left untreated , gingivitis can lead to the more advanced type of gum disease , periodontitis , which can result in the bone in your jaw decaying , and potential tooth loss			1
according to a new survey by @entity67 , only 19 per cent of us would visit the dentist if we noticed changes in our gums , compared to 46 per cent who would visit when they have trouble with their teeth @entity134 figures suggest that between 10 and 15 per cent of adults in the @entity2 suffer from severe periodontitis , with many more being affected by mild to moderate levels			1
the good news is that most gum disease is preventable and mild cases can easily be treated with an overhaul of your simple daily oral routine			1
do n’t wait until you notice bleeding or soreness when you clean , or experience bad breath ( halitosis ) or a metallic taste in your mouth			2
as with all health issues , prevention is far better than cure , so take those vital steps now and you could avoid problems later			2
@entity155 it 's important to clean properly between your teeth , yet according to a @entity67 survey , only two in five of us floss on a daily basis the first thing you need to consider is how you clean your teeth			0
it may seem obvious , but many of us have neglected to learn efficient and effective brushing methods , and have simply continued with our childhood technique , often slipping into sloppy habits			2
as with most areas of our lives , tooth care technology has vastly improved over recent years			0
toothpaste formulas have changed dramatically to include multi-tasking active treatments that not only clean but care for your teeth on a daily basis			0
even if your water supply contains fluoride , it ’s worth using toothpaste which also contains this mineral , which helps protect against tooth decay			0
ask your dentist or hygienist for their recommendation , as they will be able to offer expert advice on the best products to deliver optimum benefits for you			2
it ’s important to make regular visits to a dental hygienist , as they can help remove stubborn tartar – hardened plaque – with a regular ‘ scale and polish ’ , and monitor your oral wellbeing			0
if you ’re not sure how frequently you should see a hygienist , your dentist will make a recommendation based upon your general oral health			1
@entity204 while you are talking with your hygienist , tap into their expertise and ask for some guidance on brushing techniques			2
many people are embarrassed to do this , as they feel it is an admission that they have potentially been doing it wrong , but it ’s better correct poor habits now than continue and do further damage			0
if you ’re still using a manual brush , you may find that switching to an electric brush helps clean more thoroughly , and helps to maintain the correct , even pressure – some more expensive brushes even alert you if you ’re pressing too hard , to avoid pushing back the gumline and exposing the sensitive tooth root			0
do n’t be tempted to move the brush around your mouth constantly , though			0
let the rotating brush head do all the work for you , and simply move from one tooth to another after a few seconds			0
it should take approximately two minutes to clean all your teeth – if it helps , set a timer on your smartphone , and spend 30 seconds on each quarter of your mouth , morning and night			0
using a daily mouthwash can help control the build - up of plaque and protect against bacteria again , your hygienist will be able to advise on which type of brush head is best suited to your needs , and areas you really need to focus on			0
for example , some patients find one side of their mouth is healthier than the other , as they ’ve cleaned more enthusiastically if they are left or right - handed			0
@entity249 & @entity250 use a daily mouthwash to help control the build - up of plaque and protect against bacteria			0
if you think you ’re already showing signs of gum disease , talk to your dentist or hygienist , who may suggest you use a product containing chlorhexidine , an active ingredient that ’s clinically proven to help treat gum disease			1
products containing chlorhexidine are available over the counter , and can be an important weapon in the fight against gum disease			1
it ’s also important to clean properly between your teeth , yet according to the @entity67 survey , only two in five of us floss on a daily basis			0
so , if you ’re not doing it every day already , use floss , tape or small interdental brushes ( they come in different sizes , so seek advice on which you need , which will depend on how tightly packed together your teeth are ) to remove all remaining food debris and plaque from those crevices between your teeth .			0
