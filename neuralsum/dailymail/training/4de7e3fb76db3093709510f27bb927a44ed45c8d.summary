hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new @entity3 - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park			1
the move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant , with bosses steering them towards ' healthier ' sandwiches in the hospital 's smoothie bar instead			1
baffling : @entity19 at @entity10 's @entity9 have told patients and staff not to order from a new @entity3 - in its own car park 100 yards away			1
the shop 's @entity23 ( pictured ) slammed the advice but the advice in a weekly staff newsletter has baffled the shop 's franchisee @entity23			1
he insisted there had never been a similar problem elsewhere in @entity32 and ' a large part of our business comes from the hospital '			1
the outlet had its grand opening last month on land which the @entity40 sold to regeneration firm @entity41 in 2006			1
the developer built a 600 - space multi-storey car park , which the hospital now pays an annual fee to lease back , and included units for several shops on the same site			2
@entity49 's deal with @entity3 for one of the units - the first food shop to open - was agreed last year , and a @entity52 is soon due to open on the same site			2
the hospital 's ' ban ' was revealed in a staff newsletter			1
it said : ' @entity57 has agreed with @entity3 and @entity58 that deliveries by @entity3 into the hospital will not be allowed			1
' please ensure this message is passed on to both staff and patients			0
' stuffed trust : the hospital authority which runs @entity9 ( pictured ) sold the 16 - acre parcel of land in 2006 , and now can not control which shops open there despite it being used for the hospital 's own car park despite the objections of mr @entity23 , a hospital spokesman stood by the edict			1
she said : ' as part of our work around food hygiene and the control of visitors into clinical areas , delivery of takeaway food is not encouraged			0
' @entity57 maintains its commitment to improving healthy eating options for staff , patients and visitors			0
' the hospital opened a @entity90 in the main entrance of the hospital in march this year , which serves a range of smoothies and fresh juices alongside a healthier range of sandwiches , salads and pre-prepared fresh fruit pots			1
' the trust 's main restaurant on @entity102 serves a variety of wholesome meals such as carvery , fish dishes , vegetarian options and has a daily salad bar			2
a hospital in @entity110 came under heavy fire when it emerged it had paid £ 24,000 to close a @entity113 branch inside its own walls			0
@entity115 had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years , sparking the ire of health campaigners			0
it finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a @entity125 branch			0
but in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £ 24,000 to @entity129 , the company operating the fast food franchise			0
@entity132 admitted the ' world had changed ' since it signed the original deal in 1997			0
' @entity136 shop , located in the main entrance at the hospital stocks a full range of fresh fruit and pre-packed healthy snacks such as nuts and raisins			0
' @entity145 's @entity144 in the main entrance also has a range of healthy soups , sandwiches , salads and fresh fruit on its menu			2
' the proposed @entity154 unit planned for outside the @entity40 's main entrance will further expand the range of healthier choices available to staff , patients and visitors			1
' she added : ' the retail units are separately leased by @entity49 and the hospital has no say who leases these spaces			0
' the new shop is run by @entity23 , who has worked in the business since 2001			1
' i do n't know if this has come from the trust or someone internally off their own back , ' he said			0
' maybe someone is not happy with us delivering within the hospital ? ' in other parts of the @entity129 it is no problem whatsoever and the business is essential			2
' a large part of our business comes from the hospital and i do n't know where this has come from			1
' he added he had never agreed to restrict deliveries to the hospital and any such claims had been ' fabricated '			2
' we have been trying to contact the lady who wrote the newsletter with no success and find out what it 's all about , ' he added			0
' there is definitely no agreement and i believe somebody at the hospital has been misled			0
' @entity9 , which runs @entity9 , is facing a £ 13million financial black hole this year			2
it received a boost to its finances when it sold the 16 - acre site to @entity58 for £ 12.8million in 2006 , and hopes to pocket about £ 100,000 a year for ten years when @entity154 opens in its entrance .			0
