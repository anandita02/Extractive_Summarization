by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 06:19 est , 5 november 2012 changes : criminal justice minister @entity2 is scrapping committal hearings to cut cases by up to six weeks criminals are to be brought to justice ' within weeks not months ' under new plans to abolish committal hearings - the first stage of the court process			1
around 60,000 of the short hearings happen every year , where magistrates decide whether the accused has a case to answer			1
these will now be axed in 29 areas of @entity16 and @entity17 , cutting the length of a case by up to six weeks			1
criminal justice minister @entity2 says it will be trialled outside of @entity21 , including in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			0
but some solicitors are worried that removing a tier of justice could be damaging - although it is very rare that a case is ever thrown out at this stage			1
' abolishing committal hearings is another one of the steps we are taking to make justice swift and sure and to ensure our courts run efficiently and effectively for victims , witnesses and the taxpayers who fund them , ' mr @entity2 said			2
' the justice system needs continued improvement , and this announcement is an important step forward			0
' committal hearings are usually used to officially transfer a case from magistrates courts , where less serious crimes are dealt with , to the @entity45 , which handles the most serious offences			1
they were abolished in 2001 for ' indictable only ' offences like murder , which have to be heard at a crown court because of their seriousness			0
but now committal hearings for ' either - way ' offences , like some burglaries and drugs cases , which can be dealt with either at the magistrates of crown court , will also be scrapped			2
cuts : losing @entity59 will mean more than 60,000 hearings will go each year , saving time and money this will be replaced by new ' sending ' procedures , where magistrates will make a decision on where the case will be heard in full without the need for a hearing			1
but experts say that the changes could in fact slow the courts process , not speed it up			2
“ i do have concerns that the sending procedure for either - way offences may result in delays in the crown court while evidence is served , and i would not like to see this becoming a case of " more haste , less speed " , ' @entity76 , chairman of the @entity77 ’ @entity75 told @entity78			0
@entity88 , chairman of the @entity89 ’ @entity75 , added : ' we believe that there is every opportunity for the evidence to be tested , both by magistrates on paper and , of course , by judges in the crown court when cases come before them for a plea and directions hearing			0
but we would also like to see more cases coming through the magistrates ’ courts and would like to see our sentencing powers increased to 12 months ’ custody			0
' other changes will include courts operating beyond the traditional 10am until 4pm , including weekends and evening sessions , as well as more video links between courts , prisons and police stations to save on time and costs .			0

cutting committals , where magistrates decide if there is a case to answer , will cut legal process by up to six weeks
there are currently 60,000 of the hearings each year , but these will go in 29 areas of @entity16 and @entity17
some experts fear it will ' rush justice '
