by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 06:47 est , 2 november 2012 drugs used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain are often prescribed with simvastatin , but there are fears the combination can cause unpleasant side effects thousands of people taking a common statin are to have their dose reduced due to fears over side effects			1
the medicines regulator has warned that patients taking one particular type - simvastatin - at the same time as other drugs used to reduce high blood pressure are likely to suffer more muscle aches and pains			1
and for the first time , it has produced a patient leaflet to inform people of the changes being made			0
statins have been hailed as a wonderdrug which can slash cholesterol and protect against a host of chronic illnesses			0
but the @entity30 is concerned that some people taking other drugs with them could suffer painful muscle problems , lung disorders and kidney damage			2
every day eight million people in the @entity37 take various statins , which cost as little as 40p a day			0
@entity39 is the most frequently prescribed one ; last year @entity41 gave out almost three million prescriptions for it in @entity44 alone			1
but studies have shown that patients taking simvastatin , particularly the 40mg dose which is the most commonly prescribed in @entity44 , suffered more problems if they were also on amlodipine and diltiazem			1
these are used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain associated with heart disease and they are often prescribed with simvastatin			1
the side effects are those usually associated with statins , including muscle problems such as pain , tenderness , weakness and cramps and more rarely muscle breakdown leading to kidney damage			0
these occurred more frequently when patients were on both drugs at the same time			2
the general advice from the @entity30 is that patients should not stop taking simvastatin			1
however , if they experience any muscle pain , weakness or cramps whilst taking simvastatin , they should stop taking it and see their doctor as soon as possible			1
doctors may lower the simvastatin dose as the side effects were less common when patients were on a 20mg dose , or switch them to another statin			1
despite advocates saying that everyone over 50 should be statins , the side effects are well - documented			0
@entity39 is the most frequently prescribed statin in the @entity37 , with gps writing nearly three million prescriptions for it in @entity44 alone last year some taking the drugs suffer mild side - effects such as insomnia and stomach upsets , but others complain of agonising muscle pain and there have been reports about patients developing a rare but serious lung disorder			1
however most experts still agree that the benefits of taking them far outweigh any risks			0
patients are being advised that if they are taking simvastatin alongside either of the other two medications their doctor may review their treatment at the next routine appointment			1
an @entity30 spokesman said : ' the mhra is committed to public health and continuously monitors the safety of all medicines			0
' we have recently published information on dosing recommendations for simvastatin which were updated due to a small risk of an increase in side effects when it is used at higher doses in conjunction with amlodipine or diltiazem			0
' this advice is intended to optimise the proven beneficial effects of statins while minimising any adverse effects and should not be a reason for stopping statin treatment			0
we have advised that patients continue their treatment and discuss this with their doctor at their next routine appointment			0
' the updated information has been highlighted in our first @entity135 article designed exclusively for patients , with the aim that people taking these medicines can understand why their statin treatment may have changed			2
' @entity140 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity142 , said : ‘ this is not based on any new revelations about unknown side effects of simvastatin			0
‘ we know that side effects with this drug are dose related – the higher the dose , the greater the risk of developing muscle pain			2
because calcium channel blockers slow down the rate at which simvastatin is broken down , the drug levels in the blood stream can be higher			2
‘ therefore patients taking both simvastatin and a calcium channel blocker should discuss their dose with their gp at their next visit or when their prescription is due for renewal			1
there are alternative statins available for prescription			0

move comes after fears that patients taking simvastatin with certain blood pressure drugs are more likely to suffer muscle aches and pains
may be switched to a lower dose or different statin
@entity39 is the most frequently prescribed statin , with three million prescriptions written last year in @entity44
