the pair eventually engaged in oral sex during two sexual liaisons at the home in @entity22 , @entity23 , he shared with his mother			2
his mother was away at the time			0
but the girl - described as ‘ highly intelligent and articulate ’ - was said to have been left ‘ very shaken and angry ’ by her experiences and told a member of staff at her school			1
she later told police : ‘ he talked me into everything and he assumed i wanted everything he wanted and in the end that 's what i thought i wanted			2
’ the girl , who can not be identified for legal reasons , has since been treated for depression and has been referred to a counsellor after trying to self - harm			2
at @entity40 pleaded guilty to grooming a child for sexual activity and four counts of sexual activity with a child			0
the hearing was told the incidents occurred after @entity1 took early retirement from @entity49 in @entity50 where he had worked for 17 years			1
he visited the school voluntarily afterwards and later met the girl			2
in march this year she sent him a friend request on @entity5 and he accepted			0
‘ she developed a crush on @entity1 , ’ said @entity54 , prosecuting			1
‘ she thought he was attractive and when he paid her attention she felt flattered and started to like him even more			0
‘ the two began regular contact on @entity5 , messaging each other a couple of times a day and this soon became much more frequent and @entity1 then asked that they continue their conversations on their mobile phones			1
‘ all communication has been via text - approximately 100 per day - never any verbal calls for fear of getting caught			1
' these texts would be throughout the day , starting from very early in the morning to very late at night , leaving the girl very tired at school			1
’ on april 1 @entity1 was at a wedding of a former work colleague when he texted the girl saying he wished that ‘ she was there sharing a bed with him ’			1
mr @entity54 added : ‘ she said that this was the first time that @entity1 said anything to her which was of a sexual nature and she was freaked out by this at first and did n't know what to say but then just went along with it			1
‘ @entity1 started telling the girl what he wanted to do to her sexually			1
he sent messages stating that he could n't wait till she was 16 then it would be legal			1
things developed gradually and @entity1 said he loved her and that they would be together one day			1
’ the hearing was told the incidents occurred after @entity1 took early retirement from @entity49 in @entity50 where he had worked for 17 years at the end of april , @entity1 invited the girl into his home when his mother was away			1
during the liaison he referred to her as his ‘ girlfriend ’ and they kissed and ‘ dry humped ’ on the sofa			0
the girl asked @entity1 if she was like all the other girls but he told her : ‘ no , it 's completely different			1
’ the prosecutor said : ‘ he said he could n't wait until she was 16 and they could have sex			2
he showed her around the house , the last room being his bedroom and they both sat on the bed and began kissing			2
‘ @entity1 undid her bra and touched her breasts and undressed her			2
she described them performing oral sex on each other			2
’ the pair met again a week later at @entity1 's home and they engaged in more kissing and ‘ dry humping ’ on the sofa during which the teacher sucked the girl 's breasts			1
afterwards they continued to text but she tried to stop because she felt guilty			0
he said wanted to remain friends			0
she agreed but deleted @entity1 as a @entity5 friend			2
@entity1 , pictured here leaving @entity137 , has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison ‘ she felt that she had been used for sex , ’ added mr @entity54			1
‘ at this time she felt angry and scared and she took the decision to tell the inclusion officer at school what had been happening			0
‘ she had been suffering depression since @entity146 she had also tried to self - harm and had been referred for specialist support			0
she is a quiet , highly intelligent articulate girl and she has been greatly affected by this " relationship " which had developed beyond her control			0
’ @entity1 admitted to an affair but said the girl had instigated the explicit texts and the sexual acts at his home - and he ‘ went along with it ’			1
he was also made the subject of a @entity159 for ten years			0
judge @entity160 told him : ‘ these are serious matters because of your age gap			0
you were the adult and she was the child and it is for you to show responsibility , for you to say no and for you to desist			0
‘ when one is 14 years old and one has a sexual encounter with a 49 - year - old former teacher the impact will be profound			0
the trauma to her psychology would have been intense and the extent will not be realised for some time to come			0
‘ she was a bright student who is now struggling with the consequences of what has happened and you should have realised the potential for this risk			0
’ in mitigation defence , @entity181 said : ‘ it is abundantly clear that when he did work as a teacher he was very good indeed			0
he has thrown away his life 's work			0
’ but det sgt @entity189 , from @entity190 said after the case : ‘ the victim 's emotional and physical wellbeing has been affected as has her school work			0
‘ she has suffered enormously as a result of the abuse carried out by @entity1			2
‘ while he fully admitted what had happened he sought to minimise his responsibility and tried to blame the victim			0
as an experienced former teacher and middle - aged man i find such sentiments to be insulting to the victim and others in the profession			0

@entity1 swapped 100 text messages a day with the girl
sent photos of himself aroused and said he wished they could share a bed
told her he was looking forward to her turning 16 so they could have sex
