crows use tools and can even outsmart a human child , and now scientists have found another way in which the birds are like us			1
in tests , the birds revealed a tendency to be either left or right beaked			1
researchers studying @entity12 crows discovered the clever corvids display a preference for holding a stick tool on a certain side of their beaks - and this could be to make the most of their wide field of vision			1
crows show a tendency to be left or right beaked by holding tools such as sticks ( pictured ) on the right or left side of their beaks			1
researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads in order to use it in the most dexterous way researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads , so they can see clearly in order to use tools in the most dexterous way			1
lead scientist dr @entity53 , from @entity54 , said : ‘ if you were holding a brush in your mouth and one of your eyes was better than the other at brush length , you would hold the brush so that its tip fell in view of the better eye			1
this is what the crows do			0
’ new @entity12 crows have surprised experts with their ability to use sticks to extract larvae from burrows and , in captivity , retrieve food placed out of reach			0
the new study , published in the journal @entity72 , also suggests that the birds ' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye			1

and now the new study suggests that the birds ' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye a previous experiment by the @entity88 proved that members of the crow family are n’t just among the cleverest birds , they are smarter than most mammals - and can perform tasks that three and four - year - old children have difficulty with			1
scientists said that , while having very different brain structures , both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools , including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events , to solve similar problems			1
other experiments involving the same family of birds found that @entity12 crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food			1
the @entity54 ’s @entity113 said this was the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans			1
a separate study also found rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach			1
urban - living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts			0
co-author dr @entity130 , also from @entity54 , said : ‘ we thought that their binocular fields would facilitate binocular vision , perhaps allowing the birds to judge the distance from tool tip to target			1
' it turned out that , most frequently , they only see the tool tip and target with one eye at a time			1
’ dr @entity53 added : ‘ birds and humans face similar problems in tool use and many other activities			1
' studying similar problems across species helps to put all of them in perspective			2
’ scientists at the @entity154 at the @entity155 have been studying the intelligence of tool - making @entity12 crows for over 10 years			1
they have shown that crows can use tools to solve eight problems in a row			2
in february , dr @entity163 , a @entity164 in @entity165 set up an experiment in which a crow , named 007 , performed a series of tasks without seeing the difficult course beforehand			0
the wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity , but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat			0
the animal was later released			0
@entity179 completed the eight - stage puzzle in just two - and - a - half minutes			0
first , it pulled a string attached to the branch it perched on towards itself to reach a short stick dangling below			2
a crow , named 007 , performed a series of tasks without seeing a difficult course made up of eight problems , beforehand ( illustrated )			0
the bird completed the eight - stage puzzle in just two - and - a - half minutes crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven - year - old , research has shown			2
scientists came to the conclusion after subjecting six wild @entity12 crows to a battery of tests designed to challenge their understanding of cause and effect			2
the tasks were all variations of the @entity207 's fable , in which a thirsty crow drops stones to raise the level of water in a pitcher			2
in the ' water displacement task ' , crows worked out how to catch floating food rewards by dropping heavy objects into water - filled tubes			0
they demonstrated an ability to drop sinking rather than floating objects , solid rather than hollow objects , to choose a high water level tube over one with low water level , and a water - filled tube over one filled with sand			0
the birds ' understanding of the effects of volume displacement matched that of human children aged between five and seven , scinetists from the @entity227 of @entity228 claimed			2
the crow then picked up the short stick in its mouth to complete stage one			2
it then immediately made its way to a narrow container containing a meaty treat and tried to use the stick to reach it - but it was too short			2
the bird kept hold of the stick and made its way to the first of three boxes , which each contained a stone unreachable without the stick behind wooden bars			1
007 then used its stick to drag a stone from the first box and picked it up in its beak to complete stage two			0
but then it dropped the stone , seemingly temporarily stumped as what to do with it			0
however , the persistent creature picked up the stick again and retrieved a stone from the second of the boxes and placed it in a separate perspex container			0
007 picked up the stone it had already retrieved and posted it into the clear container too , before retrieving the final stone from the final box			0
when it posted the last of the stones into the perspex box , its weight pushed down a compartment , which allowed the crow to access a long stick and complete stage eight			0
armed with the long stick , the crow immediately used it to poke inside a narrow box treat containing a treat and dragged the morsel towards itself			0
the clever bird was rewarded for its hard work and mental agility in completing the series of eight challenges .			0

scientists from @entity54 showed the birds display a preference for holding a stick tool on the right or left side of their beaks
this may be because they are trying to keep the tip of the stick in view
*technique* enables them to use tools in the most dexterous way
study hints bird 's wide field of vision helps them see better with one eye
