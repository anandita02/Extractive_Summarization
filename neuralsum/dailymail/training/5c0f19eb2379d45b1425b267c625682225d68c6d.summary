by @entity0 they have traditionally attracted those planning on downsizing or looking to simplify their lives for financial or environmental reasons			2
but there is now another group of people benefiting from the growing small - dwelling movement - the homeless			1
efforts to construct the compact buildings are growing across the @entity13 because they are cheaper than a traditional large - scale shelter , help the recipients socially because they are built in communal settings and are environmentally friendly due to their size			1

many have been built with donated materials and volunteer labour , sometimes from the people who will live in them			1
most require residents to behave appropriately , avoid drugs and alcohol and help maintain the properties			2
still , sometimes neighbours have not been receptive			2
@entity76 , who can see the proposed site for @entity35 's tiny houses from her living room window , said she worries about noise and what her neighbours would be like			1
' there have been people who have always been associated with people who are homeless that are unsavoury types of people , ' she said			1
organizer @entity89 hopes to allay neighbours ' concerns by the time the @entity92 votes in may on the group 's application to rezone the site of a former auto body shop to place the houses there			1
plans include gardens , a chicken coup and possibly bee hives and showers and bathrooms in the main building			2
organizer @entity89 said : ' i think there is some ways we can be a real asset to the neighbourhood ' the interior of a tiny house built by @entity38 in @entity35			1

a volunteer moves it every 24 or 48 hours as required by city ordinances			2
the house , which cost about $ 5,000 , fits a double bed with overhead storage , a small table and a small room with a compostable toilet			0

@entity186 and others worked with the city , which provided them land for the project			0
@entity63 opened in september with little resistance , said @entity186 , 26 , who is on the board of directors			0

the houses do n't have electricity , water , bathrooms , showers or kitchens , but separate shared buildings do			2
they have done it all for less than $ 100,000 , which is about half the median home price in @entity63 , all from private donors with no taxpayer money			0
he said the story has changed from how tent cities were a problem in @entity13 to how the community is banding together			0
' it 's an @entity13 success story ... now we see in different cities people coming up with citizen driven solutions , ' @entity186 said			0

' we are bringing people into tangible housing but we are bringing them also into much less tangible human framework of social relations and that is the more difficult work , ' he said			0
