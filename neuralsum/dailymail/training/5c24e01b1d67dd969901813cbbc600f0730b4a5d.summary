by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 06:43 est , 5 january 2014 @entity3 's drawn - out humiliation at the hands of a resurgent @entity6 is finally over , mercifully drawing an end one of @entity3 ’s worst test series defeats			1
@entity6 obliterated @entity3 's batting in a shade over 31 overs to claim a thumping 281 - run fifth test victory with more than two days to spare and seal only the third 5 - 0 sweep in the long history of @entity15 series on sunday			1
the triumph at a sun - baked @entity17 completed a remarkable turnaround for @entity6 , who were in disarray after being swept themselves in @entity23 and going down 3 - 0 in @entity3 to lose a third successive @entity15 series last year			2
@entity3 embarrassed ! @entity6 celebrate winning the @entity15 5 - 0 in @entity17 by raising the urn elation : the moment finally comes for @entity6 as they celebrate their historic victory winning feeling : @entity30 and @entity31 kiss the urn at the awards ceremony all smiles : @entity37 high - fives @entity36 fans as he comes off the pitch where did it go wrong ? @entity41 looks dejected as he tries to contemplate @entity3 's dire performance a big clue to how @entity6 managed that turnaround came when paceman @entity45 was awarded the @entity47 medal as @entity48 after taking 37 wickets at a shade under 14 apiece over the five tests			1
@entity45 's ferocious pace again played an integral part in @entity6 's victory in @entity17 but it was no one man show and his fellow quick @entity57 won @entity48 honours after taking five for 25 as @entity3 were skittled for 166 on sunday			1
' it 's very special after the roller - coaster ride , the ups and downs of 2013 , ' said @entity6 captain @entity31 , who also played in the 2006 - 7 sweep but clearly not that of 1920 - 21			2
' it 's been a lot of work to get us where we are today			0
i said to the bowlers at the start of the series that i thought they were the best attack in the world and i think they 've shown that in five test matches			0
' @entity45 's revival was even more remarkable than that achieved by @entity6 , turning him from a figure of ridicule for @entity3 's travelling @entity79 into a bowler who struck fear into the touring batsmen			1
it was his intervention after tea on sunday that turned what had been a stately progression to victory into another humiliating rout for the tourists			0
after finally dismissing @entity89 for 119 and bowling @entity6 out for 276 , @entity3 stumbled to the break on 87 for three chasing a highly improbable 448 for victory			2
all changed now : @entity92 replicates @entity3 's famous sprinkler celebration first man down : @entity45 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity41 old head frazzled : @entity97 has to walk off the field after being removed by @entity57 for just 16 unstoppable : @entity45 's ball they kept low and nipped back to dismiss @entity101 one - handed grab : @entity103 takes a stunning catch to dismiss @entity105 at short leg @entity107 played : @entity89 pulls a ball to the boundary on his way to getting a century a fifth thumping victory had always looked on the cards after @entity6 's pace attack tore through @entity3 's top order in the first hour of day two			1
a more spectacular collapse in 11 balls after the second interval on day three made it certain with @entity45 dismissing opener @entity119 for 43 and @entity101 three balls later in the first over			0
' @entity45 's bowled a couple of spells in this series that are without doubt as good a spells as i 've seen in my career , ' said @entity31			0
' and i 've been lucky enough to play with @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
' @entity133 @entity92 took over for the next over and he dismissed @entity135 for a duck and @entity137 for four to reduce the tourists to 95 - 7 in a matter of minutes			0
with @entity3 's top order having failed yet again , @entity140 ( 32 ) and @entity141 ( 42 ) provided their country 's stiffest resistance down the order but they could only delay the inevitable			2
agility : @entity31 gets down low to take the catch dismissing @entity137 that 's out ! @entity140 drags @entity57 onto his own stumps in the second innings spinning master : @entity92 gets several pat on the backs for his efforts complete shock : @entity119 's bat snaps in half after a ball from @entity57 @entity57 bowled them both before performing the coup de grace on debutant @entity161 and the @entity17 , bathed in pink in honour of @entity129 's breast cancer charity , rose to hail the @entity6 team			0
' i think today 's batting was a culmination of being under the kosh for four and a half games , ' said @entity3 captain @entity41			1
' credit to @entity6 , i ca n't even count on how many sessions we won in the series			2
that 's a pretty daunting stat to take but a very realistic statistic			0
' @entity6 had already reclaimed the coveted urn after winning the @entity179 test by 381 runs , the @entity182 match by 218 runs , in @entity184 by 150 runs and taking an eight - wicket triumph in @entity187			0
for a dispirited @entity3 , their triumphs in @entity23 in 2012 and in @entity6 in 2010 - 11 will appear a distant memory and they face an immediate future of recrimination and rebuilding			0
raising money : @entity195 day at the @entity17 with all supporters showing their support for breast cancer problems : @entity41 stares into the crowd as he walks off after getting out to @entity45 bouncers : @entity161 's pitch map shows how short he bowled during @entity6 's second innings aside from criticisms of his captaincy , @entity41 's miserable series was a reflection of that of a vaunted batting line - up which simply failed to fire in the face of sustained pressure from the @entity36			1
the @entity3 skipper 's seven runs on sunday gave him 246 at an average of 24.6 for the series , a paltry return compared to the 766 runs at 127 he accumulated on his last trip to @entity6 in 2010 - 11 when he returned home a 3 - 1 winner			1
@entity3 's other top batsmen did not fair much better with @entity223 returning home after the defeat in the opening test to deal with stress - related issues and @entity97 and @entity105 failing to live up to their billing			1
the @entity3 bowlers have little more to crow about and one of the many statistics being bandied about to illustrate @entity6 's supremacy in the series will embarrass them			2
while @entity6 took all 100 wickets in a five - test @entity15 series for the first time , @entity3 failed to dismiss their opponent 's number 11 batsman , @entity239 , even once			1
boundary : @entity241 pulls away a ball during his short innings on the final day at the @entity17 well held : @entity137 takes a good caught and bowled to finally dismiss @entity89 all around the wicket : @entity89 wagon wheel after scoring 119			0

@entity3 out for just 166 in final test against an inspired @entity6 side
win is humiliating *bookend* to one of @entity3 's worst test series defeats
