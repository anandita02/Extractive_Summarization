a huge crowd of people , many of whom carried @entity74 flags , had gathered outside the museum to see the couple arrive , with prince @entity4 taking the opportunity to share a joke with some of the locals during a walkabout			1

following the visit to the museum , the couple continued on to the @entity87 , where they got an insight into the country 's infamous drug problem courtesy of a haul of submarines confiscated from drug gangs and now displayed outside the school			0
not sure : at first , @entity48 looked a little wary about trying on her black and white sombrero vueltiao hat this is how you do it : an obliging local man then showed her how to put on and wear the hat what do you think : the pair then looked to the @entity4 to see what he thought of the @entity107 ' new look success ! clearly delighted with @entity4 ' verdict , @entity48 beamed for the cameras as @entity34 looked on afterwards , @entity4 and @entity48 will continue on to a war memorial dedicated to the @entity39 soldiers who died during an attempt to take the city 's @entity114 in 1741 before attending the @entity116 where the @entity4 will make a speech			1

in a speech about how he had ' experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence ' and stress , he added : ' many of you will probably not know that my own much - loved great - uncle , @entity56 , and members of his family ... were murdered in @entity181 , just over 30 years ago			0
' so i feel i do understand something of the bewildering and soul - destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure			0
' @entity4 was extremely close to his uncle , who died in a terrorist bombing in august 1979			0
