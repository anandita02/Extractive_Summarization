lots of acounts , few passwords : new research out on monday revealed the spiralling number of internet accounts is behind a dramatic rise in online fraud the average @entity8 now has 26 online accounts , yet uses just five passwords to keep them secure			1
remembering a huge number of different passwords is simply impossible for most of us			2
but using the same password , for instance , across an email account and an online banking account can leave people terrifyingly vulnerable to hackers			1
new research out on monday revealed the spiralling number of internet accounts is behind a dramatic rise in online fraud			1
fraudsters in the @entity24 illegally traded more than 12 million pieces of personal information online in the first four months of 2012 alone			1
figures from credit checkers @entity27 says online fraud has increased three fold since 2010 , when 9.5 million pieces of information were traded illegally			1
online accounts cover everything from banking to utility bills to social networks , with 25 to 34 - year - olds signing up to an average 40 accounts			1
the number is set to grow , with nearly one in five people ( 17 % ) signing up to six or more new accounts every month			0
one in four of the 2,000 people quizzed use a single password for the majority of accounts and one in 20 ( four per cent ) sticking with the same login details for all their accounts			0
@entity27 says people are putting themselves further at risk by no longer using many of their accounts - meaning passwords are not changed regularly			2
six in 10 adults ( 66 per cent ) admit to having defunct profiles that hold valuable personal and financial information , including social network profiles ( 26 per cent ) , email addresses ( 18 per cent ) and shopping accounts ( 21 per cent )			0
@entity62 , managing director at @entity63 , said : ‘ the problem is that most people do n't realise there is huge market for login credentials - email and password combinations			0
‘ these outnumber sales of credit card details by nine to one because they give access to a huge amount of other valuable information , such as address books and related accounts			2
‘ using a different password for each account will minimise risks , but if password information is stolen from a website , all accounts using the same details will be compromised , and this information can spread among fraudsters rapidly			2
‘ changing passwords after a theft can be like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted			0
users need to protect themselves with a service like @entity93 's web monitoring , which will alert them by text or email if details turn up somewhere they should n't			0
’ two million people said they have been victims of online fraud , leading to debt and refused loans or credit cards .			0
