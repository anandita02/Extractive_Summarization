the government finally released @entity2 enrollment figures monday and the findings could spell higher premiums for those who need coverage most			1
enrollments are lower for the healthy , younger @entity7 are needed to keep premiums from rising because they pay more and take less from the system			1
according to the statistics , it 's an older , costlier crowd that 's signing up so far under president @entity15 's law and officials fear the age gap could make the government subsidized health coverage too costly for the middle - aged and older			1
unexpected : the @entity21 released @entity2 enrollment figures for the first time monday and numbers show middle aged @entity7 are signing up the most despite the laws original intend to help cover uninsured young people the @entity21 reports that middle - aged @entity7 make up the bulk of the 2 million @entity2 enrollees			1
the major targets of the law creating subsidized health insurance were young adults , who are healthy and pay more into the system and take less thus keeping premiums down overall			1
however , monday 's report shows that young people are mostly passing on the new , cheaper healthcare			2
33 percent of enrollees are aged 55 to 64 22 percent are aged 45 to 54 24 percent were aged 18 to 34 and it ’s the middle aged who are , for now , signing up the most			1
adults ages 55 - 64 were the most heavily represented in the signups , accounting for 33 percent of the total			1
overall , the premiums paid by people in that demographic do n't fully cover their medical expenses			0
some are in the waiting room for @entity50 ; that coverage starts at age 65			0
young adults from 18 to 34 are only 24 percent of total enrollment , the administration said in its first signup figures broken down for age , gender and other details			1
with the @entity62 website now working , the figures cover the more than 2 million @entity7 who had signed up for government - subsidized private insurance through the end of december in new federal and state markets			1
enrolling young and healthy people is important because they generally pay more into the system than they take out , subsidizing older adults			1
while 24 percent is not a bad start , say independent experts , it should be closer to 40 percent to help keep premiums @entity77 questions remained unanswered			0
for example , the administration is unable to say how of many of those enrolling for coverage had been previously uninsured			0
some might have been among the more than 4.7 million insured people whose previous policies were cancelled because they did n't meet the law 's standards			2
‘ the uninsured folks for whom the law was intended do n't seem to have signed up in nearly as high numbers , ’ said @entity87 , a former statistics chief for the @entity89 department			2
‘ there is still a huge unknown aspect to this			0
’ @entity7 secretary of health and human services @entity96 could have a headache on her hands if more young people do n't enroll in an @entity2 plan but even if the age mix remains tilted toward older adults , ‘ it 's nothing of the sort that would trigger instability in the system , ’ said @entity102 , an insurance expert with the nonpartisan @entity104			1
premiums would go up next year for the overhaul , along with taxpayer costs per enrollee , but not enough to push the system into a ‘ death spiral ’ in which rising premiums discourage healthy people from signing up			2
@entity102 and other experts expected older , sicker people to be more heavily represented in the early numbers			0
they would have had strong motivation to persevere in the face of website @entity124 , he said ‘ it underscores a need to heighten outreach efforts to young people			2
’ adults ages 18 - 34 represent 40 percent of the target group for the health care law , according to a recent @entity104 study			1
open enrollment ends march 31			2
considering that the federal health care website was down most of the time in october , administration officials said they were pleased that the percentage of young adults was as high as it was			1
‘ we think that more and more young people are going to sign up as time goes by , ’ said @entity139 , head of the @entity89 office in charge of @entity15 's push to cover the uninsured			2
and there 's a hammer , too : those who fail to sign up face a tax penalty in 2015 for being uninsured			0
making bets : to keep premiums affordable , officials say they need 40 percent of enrollees to be in the 18 to 34 age group officials remain confident they 'll be able to get young adults interested			1
insurers , nonprofit groups , and advocates are moving ahead with marketing campaigns that were put on hold when the federal website that serves 36 states was struggling			0
administration officials said that in the coming weeks they plan to increase outreach to young people in 25 communities located in states served by the federal website			0
that effort includes a national youth enrollment day on feb. 15 and targeted outreach by sororities and fraternities , as well as @entity174 , which focuses on @entity176 youth			0
in @entity178 , 19 - year - old college student @entity177 was one of the last - minute online signups as 2013 drew to a close			0
in about an hour , the part - time waitress signed up for a plan with a $ 158 monthly premium , with the feds kicking in $ 48			2
she has a $ 2,500 deductible			0
@entity186 said she had no trouble navigating the website			0
' many people have a preconceived notion that young people are healthy and do n't need to go to the doctor , ' said @entity186 , who suffered a minor injury when she fell and hit her head during an indoor soccer class in 2012			0
' not having to worry about being uninsured and the what - ifs has made an incredible impact on my life			0

new enrollment statistics show middle aged @entity7 the *vastly* *outnumber* young adults 18 to 34
the system needs younger , healthier *buyers* paying into the system to keep costs down for the more sickly
more than 2 million @entity7 signed up for government - subsidized private insurance through the end of december
