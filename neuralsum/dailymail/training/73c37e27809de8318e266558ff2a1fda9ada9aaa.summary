in a survey of 7,500 members , @entity13 found that the problem is widespread , with 21 per cent of teachers polled revealing that they had been the victim of abuse			1
a further 26 per cent said that videos or photos of them had been uploaded online without their consent			2
one worried teacher said that a student had set up a @entity34 page with the sole intent of telling her that he intended to kill her			2
she said : ' facebook page set up by a pupil who claimed he wanted to kill me			0
' another teacher admitted that a student took to social media site @entity42 and wrote : ' you are a paedo , and your daughter is a whore			1
' in other encounters , of pupils bullying those in charge , teachers told how they received comments about their sexuality and racial abuse , with one saying ' they referred to me as a monkey			2
' the overwhelming majority of comments are posted on @entity34 by secondary school pupils			2
however , of those teachers receiving comments by pupils , 47 per cent said they had received insulting comments and 50 per cent had read a comment about their performance as a teacher			0
angry parents : at least 27 per cent of abuse came from parents but teachers say nothing is being done the high level of disrespect from children towards their teachers has led the @entity13 to call for the government to do more to tackle the problem - before it gets completely out of control			1
at its conference in @entity80 , it said the the government is caught up in bureaucracy and is failing to do enough to ensure that teachers can work in a safe environment , free from harassment			0

according to the poll , at least 27 per cent of abuse came from angry parents , 64 per cent were sent by pupils and 9 per cent were sent by both			0
abuse by secondary school students is most prolific , however , infant school students aged from four to seven were also using the internet to send hate - filled messages			0
@entity98 , general secretary of the @entity13 , said : ' technology has transformed the working and social lives of many teachers and enhanced the learning experiences of pupils			2
' however , it is clear that steps need to be taken to protect teachers from the abuse of social media by pupils and parents			1
stop the abuse : @entity98 , general secretary of the @entity13 is calling on the government to do more to stop teachers being bullied by students ' teachers are often devastated by the vile nature of the abuse they are suffering			1
' teachers are often traumatised by the attacks made on them through social media			1
' some have lost their confidence to teach once they see foul and personal remarks made by pupils in their classes and have left the profession			0
however , many do not want to report the abuse to their school or to the police , with at least 58 per cent polled saying that they refused to report the vicious attacks on them			2

and if they did report the abuse to their headteacher , 40 per cent said nothing was done and no action had been taken against pupils			0
ms @entity144 added : ' others have been so disturbed by the comments that their health has been affected			0
' great strides had been made by the previous government , working in partnership with the @entity13 and other teacher unions and social media providers , in seeking to address this problem			1
however , a further 77 per cent said nothing was done when the police became involved and 76 per cent said nothing was done to stop the parents who sent the messages to them			0
she said : ' @entity162 guidance had been produced about social media and internet safety which promoted good practice for schools on how to protect staff , and indeed pupils , from abuse			1
' one of the @entity172 ’s first acts was to remove the guidance on the grounds that it was unnecessary bureaucracy			0
' schools need policies which prevent abuse and identify sanctions which will be taken against parents and pupils who abuse staff in this way			0
' schools should also be supporting staff in securing the removal of the offensive material from social media sites and encouraging the staff concerned to go to the police			1
