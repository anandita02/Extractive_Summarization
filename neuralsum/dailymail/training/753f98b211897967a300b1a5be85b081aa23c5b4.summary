by @entity0 published : 04:18 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 07:53 est , 14 june 2013 pensioners in their 60s and 70s have seen their incomes rise steadily during the recession years - and now they are less likely to be poor than any other group in society , according to a new report			1
by contrast young people in their 20s have suffered a major drop in their living standards since the onset of the downturn , and middle - earners among twentysomethings have lost the most , with a 12 per cent income fall			2
the analysis from the @entity20 comes in a week which has seen rising controversy over the wealth and lifestyles of older people			1
all smiles : older people are now less likely to be poor than any other group , according to the @entity20 a senior @entity29 cleric , @entity28 the right reverend @entity30 , said the ‘ fortunate generation ’ in their 60s are soaking up too much taxpayers ’ money and that state spending on older people ‘ raises questions of intergenerational equity ’			1
the bishop ’s critics accuse him of ignoring the way the older generation have worked and saved for their lifestyles and of trying to create a divide between old and young			0
the @entity20 report said : ‘ differences between age groups are not new but reflect longer term trends			1
‘ pensioners have consistently seen faster income growth than other family types and age groups over the past 30 years			0
’ reasons for higher incomes among older people over the past three decades have included the spread of good occupational pensions during the 1960s , 70s and 80s , and the introduction of more generous means - tested benefits for low - income pensioners by the @entity61 government after 1997			2
larger numbers of older people are also staying in jobs rather than taking retirement			0
official figures this week showed that more than a million over- 65s are now working , double the numbers of 20 years ago			2
‘ individuals aged 60 or above are the only age group not to see real falls in median income since the recession , ’ the report said , adding that incomes for older people have grown by between two and three per cent between 2007 and 2012			1
since the late 1970s , it said , pensioner incomes have gone up at an average rate of about two per cent a year , double the rise enjoyed by working - age people			1
age gap : the @entity20 analysis showed how the over- 65s are better off now than have ever been , while most other age groups have lower incomes than in 2007 - 08 and 2001 - 02 younger working people without children have seen incomes go up at only a third of the pace of the increasing wealth of older people			1
@entity20 economist @entity92 said : ‘ this is in many ways a triumph of social policy			1
‘ but these figures also confirm that it is young people who have suffered most as a result of the recent recession and who are now at risk of falling further behind			0
‘ it is important that policymakers and politicians understand these profound changes to patterns of low incomes and respond accordingly			2
’ for people in their 20s , there was no real rise in incomes between 2001 and 2008 , and a sharp drop during the recession years , the report said			1
it said young adults with jobs and no children lost out in the 80s and 90s as incomes rose for the best paid , and that from the late 1990s onwards ‘ earnings growth was generally weak for this group right across the income distribution			1
’ some politicians , including work and pensions secretary @entity127 , have suggested that depressed wages for less skilled young people were at least in part a result of large - scale immigration that meant millions of newcomers to the country were competing for jobs			0
the @entity20 report , funded by the left - leaning research group the @entity137 , came on the day that official poverty figures showed that average incomes fell again last year			1
income : this graph shows how from 1978 to 2008 almost every group saw their incomes increase , but only the over- 60s have seen their earnings rise from 2007 to 2012 a three per cent fall in average income in the year to last march - to £ 427 a week before housing costs are paid - was roughly the same drop as in the previous year			1
as a result real average incomes are at roughly the same level as 10 years ago			2
the across - the - board fall in earnings meant that poverty levels stayed the same when measured as ‘ relative poverty ’ , the number of people living on incomes below 60 per cent of the average			2
but 900,000 people , including 300,000 children , fell below the 60 per cent line from the previous year after incomes are adjusted for inflation			0
this measure is known as ‘ absolute poverty ’			0
the @entity166 said : ‘ this was due to incomes not increasing as fast as inflation which was very high and is now coming down			0
’ work and pensions secretary @entity127 said the previous @entity61 government had been ‘ fixated ’ by poverty lines and ‘ despite paying out £ 170 billion in tax credits alone , they failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by 2010 and far too many children were left behind			0
’ he added that welfare reforms would cut real poverty by giving people incentives to get off benefits and take jobs			0
but @entity61 shadow work and pensions secretary @entity184 said : ‘ the devastating verdict is in - in just one year this government has pushed a million people into absolute poverty and progress in tackling relative child poverty has completely stalled			0
‘ what these figures show is living standards are collapsing to their lowest level in a decade , and that is forcing an extra 300,000 children to grow up in absolute poverty			0

over- 60s have seen incomes rise steadily since start of the downturn
now group least likely to be poor in society , according to @entity20
