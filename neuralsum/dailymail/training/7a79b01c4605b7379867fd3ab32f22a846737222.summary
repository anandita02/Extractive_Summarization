by @entity0 marvellous memories are often attributed to elephants , but scientists have discovered that plants can also learn and remember – even though they do not have a brain			1
scientists claim fern - like plants that respond to touch have learned that water droplets are not harmful and remember the finding weeks afterwards			1
their research suggests that experience teaches plants to learn details to survive and could lead to scientists viewing flora in a new way			1
scientists claim fern - like plants @entity18 ( pictured ) that respond to touch , learned that water droplets are not harmful in an experiment and remember the lesson for weeks afterwards @entity22 is also called the sensitive plant , sleepy plant and the touch - me - not			1
its leaves fold inwards and droop when touched or shaken to protect it from predators and re-open minutes later			2
the species is native to @entity31 and @entity32			0
it is known for its rapid plant movement as the foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light			0
the leaves also close when touched , warmed , blown - upon or shaken - known as seismonastic movements			0
the movement occurs when specific regions of cells lose turgor pressure , which is the force that is applied onto the cell wall by water within cells			0
when the plant is disturbed , specific regions on the stems are stimulated to release chemicals including potassium ions which force water out of the cells and the water diffuses out of the cells , producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse			0
this differential stiffness between regions of cells , leads to the closing of the leaflets			0
the researchers studied @entity22 , which folds inwards when touched to protect itself from predators			1
the @entity66 study , which also involved professor @entity67 at the @entity68 in @entity69 , found the action is not simply a reflex			1
they examined the species ’ short and long - term memories under both high and low light environments by repeatedly dropping water on the plants using a custom - designed apparatus to look at their response			2
the strange fauna stopped curling up once it learned that the water was not a threat to its survival and no damage was done , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity88			2
@entity90 plants were able to acquire the learnt behaviour in a matter of seconds and as in animals , learning was faster in low light			2
‘ most remarkably , these plants were able to remember what had been learned for several weeks , even after environmental conditions had changed , ' the researchers said			1
the study shows that @entity22 plants can learn and remember just as well as it would be expected of animals , but of course , they do it all without a brain			1

the findings may make some think of @entity117 's ' ents ' in @entity118 ( pictured ) that are trees that can think and talk while the scientists are unsure who the plant learns and remembers , they think it might be down to a calcium - based signally network in its cells , which are in some ways similar to animals ’ memory process			1
the research radically changes the way humans perceive plants and the boundaries between plants and animals , including our definition of learning as a property special to organisms with a nervous system , the scientists said			1
dr @entity144 , an @entity145 research fellow at the university ’s @entity146 , who led the study , only recently published a paper that claims plants can ‘ talk ’ using sounds			2
the research at the university suggests that plants have abilities widely used by animals and seen in @entity117 ’s @entity118 , where fictional @entity158 - a race of beings which resemble trees that are ancient shepherds of the forest - are able to think and talk			1
@entity164 : it is claimed sagebrush plants ( pictured ) send chemical messages through the air a previous study in 2009 found that members of the vegetable kingdom can communicate with each other			2
they are ' capable of more sophisticated behaviour than we imagined , ' says @entity177 bug expert professor @entity176			0
his work , which he admits is ' controversial ' , suggested that plants converse by sending chemical messages through the air , warning of hungry predators			0
when a neighbouring plant ' hears ' the message , it boosts its defences against grasshoppers , caterpillars and other invaders , he believes			0
professor @entity176 , of the @entity192 , claimed to have proved that conversations happen between sagebrush bushes - hardy , yellow - flowered shrubs native to the western @entity177 using scissors , he clipped away at leaves and stems of potted shrubs , damaging them in the same way as a grasshopper would			0
he then planted some damaged and undamaged plants in a field and measured levels of predation on their neighbours			0
the leaves of the plants with clipped neighbours suffered the least grasshopper damage , according to the journal @entity211 .			0

scientists from the @entity66 found @entity22 plants can learn and remember as well as some animals
@entity217 responds to touch and curls up to protect itself from predators
but eventually ' learned ' not to curl up when rain drops landed on it
researchers are *n't* certain why the plants are able to do so , but think it might be down to a calcium - based signally network in their cells
study suggests experience teaches plants to learn details to survive
