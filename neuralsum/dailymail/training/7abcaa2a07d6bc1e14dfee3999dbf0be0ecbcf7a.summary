sick patients are being forced to wait up to four weeks for a gp appointment at a surgery where each doctor can see 100 patients a day			1
chronic health conditions , an ageing population and problems recruiting doctors are pushing services to breaking point at the @entity11 in @entity12 , near @entity13			1
its waiting list for non-urgent appointments is thought to be the longest in the country			1
patients at the @entity11 in @entity12 near @entity13 face four - week waits for an appointment @entity21 , 32 , said a three - week delay in getting an appointment meant that her minor illness became much more serious			1
‘ it ’s really frustrating			0
i ’m a full - time nursing student and i need to see someone when i ’m off , ’ she said			0
‘ you put it off and end up getting worse			0
i had a chest infection and it turned into pleurisy			0
‘ it was awful – you ca n’t move , you ca n’t breathe , the pressure in your chest is unreal			0
’ retired care worker @entity36 , 71 , said : ‘ i ’ve only been in the practice two years but when i first came you got an appointment more or less the next day			2
‘ it ’s a real worry especially as you get older because you never know what ’s going to happen			0
’ surgery partner dr @entity41 , who earns a £ 60,000 salary and regularly works 80 - hour weeks , said : ‘ i ’ve seen 50 patients today and it ’s not even been four hours			1
i ’ve got six more hours to go			2
‘ i ’ve seen infections , mental health problems , bereavements , employment issues , someone who wants me to write them a letter regarding their housing situation			0
’ he added : ‘ established gps are leaving because the work load is becoming untenable			0
‘ i have two locum gps come in – they will work but they do n’t want a permanent post because that ties you into the level of commitment and workload which they do n’t want to accept ... it ’s no wonder that with the proportion of the @entity68 budget [ for general practice ] eroded from 11 per cent to 8 per cent , that you then start seeing a huge influx of patients ending up in @entity73			2
’ doctors and patients at the surgery have all complained about the workload which causes long delays a survey by the @entity80 last year found that nationwide , only one in three patients can secure a same - day gp appointment			1
more than one in five have to wait longer than a week , while 4 per cent have to wait two to three weeks			1
research by the @entity86 found that a 50 per cent increase in the number of family doctors will be needed by 2020 to cope with population changes and the current shortage			2
patients at @entity93 with an urgent problem can be seen the same day – but the system relies on the person initially assessing themselves			2
they have to ask the receptionist for an emergency appointment , then speak to a doctor on the telephone who will decide			0
practice manager @entity102 said : ‘ it ’s dependent on what a patient thinks is urgent or not and we all have different scope			0
‘ so if it ’s a mum with young children she might be less tolerant than a working man who is trying to fit it in , or an elderly woman who has got nobody to help her			0
’ dr @entity41 said : ‘ we are now living longer , we now have a lot more chronic medical conditions – hypertension , diabetes , thyroid disease , arthritis			1
‘ if we had enough funding to hire two more practice nurses and a couple of @entity57 then fantastic , that waiting list would come down significantly			1
’ dr @entity126 , chairman of the @entity86 , said : ‘ it is essential that practices have procedures in place to prioritise those patients with the most urgent needs and sometimes this means non-urgent patients having to wait longer			1
‘ but in many cases , patients do n’t know if something is seriously wrong until they have seen their gp , and waiting a month for a @entity138 appointment could be a risk to patient safety			1
’ have you had to wait longer than three or four weeks to see a doctor ? email : @entity145			0
