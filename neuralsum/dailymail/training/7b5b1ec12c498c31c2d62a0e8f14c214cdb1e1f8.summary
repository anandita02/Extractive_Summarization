at the top , they 'll be able to see the skyline of @entity37 52 miles away as the name suggests , the roller coaster is not for the faint - hearted			1
the ' drop ' is higher than @entity42 and travels at speeds of 90mph			1
forty - one riders are hoisted into the sky and then rocketed back to earth while @entity15 trains launch toward them at speeds of up to 128mph			2
riders will pause for a few terrifying moments at a point twice as tall as the @entity4 , allowing them to catch a glimpse of the skyscrapers in @entity37 52 miles away before gravity plunges them back to ground level in less than 10 seconds			1
following the recent topping off of the track , the construction , maintenance and engineering teams will now focus on installing the lift mechanism , adding the three gondolas that will whisk riders to the top of the tower			0
then , after extensive ride testing , inspections and certification , the first passengers will be able to board the ride later in may			0
the record for tallest tower ride was previously held by the 400ft @entity74 : drop of doom at @entity76 near @entity77			2
talking about ride park president @entity78 said : ‘ @entity9 solidifies @entity17 ’s dominance as the @entity81 ’s thrill capital			1
' you ’re going to have folks dropping 90mph			0
' you ’re going to have the @entity15 cars racing around them at the same time			0
it ’s really going to be fantastic			0
fantastic views , but also terribly exciting			0
' park spokesperson @entity88 said : ‘ it 's definitely exciting that we are breaking a world record			2
' mammoth : each tower will feature a gondola for eight riders , which will help keep queues as short as possible @entity9 will be attached to @entity15 , the world 's tallest roller coaster			1
at right is an actual photo of @entity15			0
at left is a rendering of how the coaster will look with @entity9 attached meanwhile , the park says this is the last season for its wooden @entity107 roller coaster after more than three decades			1
‘ there are definitely guests , especially roller coaster enthusiasts , who will miss @entity107 , ’ @entity88 said			1
the park says technology has surpassed the dual track coaster , which opened in 1979 and has become a beloved classic			0
@entity9 is scheduled to open in summer 2014			1
thrill ride developers at @entity116 acknowledge that the park 's newest attraction might not be everyone 's idea of a good time			2
@entity124 's @entity123 opens on may 1 , and riders will be seated upright and whisked to the top of a 335 - foot tower , then the seat will pivot 90 degrees so the guest is looking straight down			2
that 's when the ride plunges in a six - second free fall			1
@entity132 , director of design and engineering at @entity116 , said riders will reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour on the plunge			0
' it 's a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster , ' said @entity132			1
' it 's really polarizing			0
you 're either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all			0
' an artist 's impression shows how @entity146 will look : the ride will seat riders upright , take them to the top of a 335 - foot tower , then pivot seats 90 degrees so riders face straight down as they plunge 60 mph in a six - second free fall park officials say it 's the tallest , free - standing drop tower in @entity156 as while @entity157 and @entity9 are taller they are both integrated with other rides or buildings			1
' drop towers have been popular at theme parks for many years , but what you see with @entity124 's @entity123 is the industry 's relentless drive for innovation , ' said @entity168 , editor - in - chief of @entity169			1
' ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic attractions , and @entity123 's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill			2
putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride			2
@entity124 's @entity123 stands alone , and @entity132 says guests can see downtown @entity182 and even @entity183 some 30 miles away once at the top			0
guests must be 54 inches tall to ride			0
a circular gondola of 32 seats takes the riders to the top of the tower — once there , a computer program determines how long the riders will stay at the peak before the gut - wrenching plunge			2
@entity132 said the wait time at the top will be randomised , anywhere from one to five seconds			0
' the only thing you 're going to hear is your heart beat , ' he joked			0
on the 60 mile - per - hour drop , the seats will be pulled back , to give riders a feeling of ' ripping ' a parachute cord , said @entity132			2
the park wanted more of a scary , thrill ride to debut this year , he said , following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows			0
@entity124 's @entity123 is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called @entity213 that includes new retail and food areas .			0
