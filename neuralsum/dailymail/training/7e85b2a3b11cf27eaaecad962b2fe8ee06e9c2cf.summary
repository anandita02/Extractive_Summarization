by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 30 may 2013 probiotics found in natural yogurt could help boost a person ’s mood because they affect brain function , according to new research			2
previous studies had shown that beneficial bacteria affected the brains of rats but no research has confirmed that the same occurred in human brains			0
the study found that those who ate probiotic yoghurt twice daily for a month showed altered brain function , both in resting brain activity and in response to an ' emotional attention task ' , which was designed to monitor how the brain responded to certain emotions			1
dairy goodness : scientists discovered that eating probiotic yogurt twice a day for a month reduced activity in areas of the brain associated with emotion and pain it has been known for some time that symbiotic gut bacteria , the complex ecosystem of microorganisms that live in the human digestive system , promote health by boosting immunity , aiding digestion , as well as maintain a healthy weight and blood pressure			1
it has also been known that the brain sends signals to the gut , which is why stress and other emotions can contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms			2
this study shows that signals travel the opposite way as well			0
‘ our findings indicate that some of the contents of yogurt may actually change the way our brain responds to the environment			0
‘ when we consider the implications of this work , the old sayings " you are what you eat " and " gut feelings ' " take on new meaning , ’ said dr. @entity56 of @entity58 's @entity57 , who led the study			0
beneficial bacteria found in fermented products such a yoghurt have long been known to boost immunity ‘ time and time again we hear from patients that they never felt depressed or anxious until they started experiencing problems with their gut			1
‘ our study shows that the gut - brain connection is a two - way street , ’ she added			2
@entity56 's team recruited 36 women of a healthy weight aged between 18 and 53			0
they were assigned to one of three groups			0
one group ate a yogurt with live bacterial cultures containing probiotic strains such as @entity88 , @entity90 thermophiles , and @entity91 twice a day for one month			0
another ate a dairy product which contained no living bacteria , and another was given no dairy products at all			0
before and after the one - month study period , the researchers conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity99 ) brain scans on the women			2
in each session , they started with a five - minute scan of the brain at rest , while the women lay still with their eyes closed			0
afterwards , the participants were asked to perform an ‘ emotional faces attention task ’ , in which their brains were scanned while they matched a series of angry or fearful faces on a computer screen to other faces that appeared			0
the results showed that during the emotional task , women who ate the probiotic yogurt had reduced activity in a brain network that included the somatosensory cortex - which receives sensory information - and the insula , a brain region that integrates sensory feedback from internal parts of the body including the gut			1
you are what you eat ? : probiotic yoghurts are already very popular in the @entity131			0
the findings show that nutritional therapy could one day play a vital role in treating patients with disorders that cause pain and emotional upset they also had reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex , precuneus , and basal ganglia , which handle aspects of cognition and emotion			1
the women who ate non-probiotic yogurt or no dairy showed either no change , or an increase of activity in this network over time			0
in the resting state , the brain scans of the women who ate probiotic yogurt showed stronger connectivity in a neural network which connects the periaqueductal grey ( @entity159 ) & mdash a region of the brainstem involved in responding to pain and emotional stimuli — to areas of the prefrontal cortex related to aspects of cognition like decision - making			1
experts hope that one day probiotics may provide a therapy for neurological conditions such as @entity172 's the women who ate no dairy , however , had stronger connectivity of the @entity159 to sensory and emotion - related parts of the brain , like the insula , somatosensory cortex , and amygdala			1
the mechanisms behind these changes are unclear , wrote the researchers , but it 's clear that gut bacteria send molecular signals to the brain that can change over time			1
dr. @entity188 , who also worked on the study , said that what we eat alters the way our gut bacteria breaks down food			2
while diets high in vegetables and fibre promote healthy gut bacteria , the typical @entity196 diet full of fats , sugars , and carbohydrates , can do the opposite			2
the research team hopes to identify which signals from the gut bacteria lead to a shift in brain activity			1
people with digestive conditions linked to gut dysbiosis ( an imbalances in gut bacteria ) such as irritable bowel syndrome , might show such shifts in brain response if they are treated with probiotics			1
dr @entity188 also suggested that specific probiotic strains in yogurt could have health benefits such as relieving anxiety , stress , and other mood symptoms over time			0
as tests to analyse bacteria growth in individuals become more readily available , it will become easier to see how someone 's gut bacteria makeup influences factors like brain development , stress , and pain sensitivity			1
it is possible that changing the composition of gut bacteria could lead to treatments for chronic pain disorders , he said , as well as symptoms of brain conditions like autism , @entity247 's , and alzheimer 's disease .			1

@entity250 researchers found that eating yoghurt twice daily reduced activity in areas of the brain associated with emotion and pain
but there was increased activity in areas associated with decision - making
mechanisms behind changes are unclear but it is clear that gut bacteria send signals to the brain that can change over time depending on diet
scientists hope that a probiotic therapy may one day be available for conditions including anxiety , depression and even autism and @entity172 's
