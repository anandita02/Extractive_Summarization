the ' lenient ' suspended sentence handed to a teacher convicted of having sex with a 16 - year - old pupil at school and at home can not be reviewed because of a legal loophole , it was revealed today			1
dozens complained when @entity9 walked free yesterday but because his sex offence is not within the attorney general 's unduly lenient sentence review scheme it can not be changed			1
the religious education teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust after taking the girl 's virginity in a school store cupboard and later taking her home for sex while his wife was out			1
@entity9 was spared jail for the offence but it emerged today that he has launched an appeal to overturn the conviction and clear his name			1
but the judge who gave him an 18 - month suspended sentence , mrs justice @entity35 , will be investigated after complaints over her comments in court when she said his victim ' groomed ' him			1
spared jail : teacher @entity9 , pictured during the trial with his wife @entity42 , had sex with a student and took her virginity but was given a suspended sentence after a judge said the girl ' groomed ' him if the @entity49 believe there is a case to answer the judge , whose own website warns ' cross me at your peril , ' could be censured , suspended or even sacked			1
yesterday the attorney general 's office ( ago ) said that it would consider whether to refer @entity9 's sentence to the @entity59 after receiving a number of complaints			1
but today in an embarrassing climbdown an @entity57 spokesman said : ' after a number of complaints , we carefully considered whether @entity9 's sentence could be referred to the @entity59 for being too low - as part of the ' unduly lenient sentence scheme '			1
' mr @entity9 's crimes are not included in this scheme , meaning the law officers are unable to refer this			1
' however , it 's important that the public can challenge what they believe to be exceptionally low sentences			2
we have been looking at whether the scope of the current scheme is right			0
' probe : judge @entity35 will be investigated by the @entity49 after she said @entity9 was ' groomed ' by the schoolgirl he abused the 44 - year - old was given only an 18 - month suspended sentence after the judge indicated her sympathy for him			1
however , his instructing solictor @entity86 today revealed that @entity9 has launched an appeal to try and get the conviction overturned			1
mr @entity86 said : ' what i can tell you at this stage , is that not only is he planning to appeal , we actually lodged the appeal with the @entity59 well before @entity94			1
' it was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction			2
' ' i lodged it within 14 days of his conviction			0
' last night the officer of the attorney general has now confirmed it is considering if the sentence handed down was too lenient - but in an embarrassing climbdown has now said it can not review it			1
this means that despite 22 complaints from the public @entity9 's sentence can not be changed			1
the attorney general 's office ( ago ) tweeted last night : ' ago have received complaints about @entity9 sentence and will consider whether to refer to @entity59 under @entity114 ( unduly lenient sentences ) scheme			1
' @entity9 's sentence will be considered			1
decision due by february 11			0
' judge @entity120 's suspended sentence and comments during the hearing have sparked controversy and complaints			1
she told @entity9 : ' there is no evidence that you groomed her			1
it was she who groomed you and you gave into temptation when you were vulnerable			2
' @entity131 , a leading government adviser on online child safety , described the judge 's actions as bizarre			2
' i have n't seen all the evidence the judge did but i doubt i will be alone in finding her remarks utterly baffling , ' he said			2
' how can a 44 - year - old man be seduced by a minor who is in his care ? ' @entity143 , of the @entity144 , said : ' judge @entity35 's reported comments in sentencing @entity9 are astonishing in that they literally blame the young victim for his actions			1
' this case shows how such deeply held prejudicial attitudes permeate the criminal justice system at all levels and raises serious questions about the adequacy of judicial training on sexual violence			2
' a spokesman for the attorney general 's office said : ' the office will now ask prosecutors to send us more information on this case , so that one of the law officers can decide whether the sentence should be referred to the @entity59 for review			1
' evidence jurors were told how @entity9 , pictured , took the pupil 's virginity in the same week his wife @entity42 suffered a miscarriage but judge @entity35 said he was ' emotionally vulnerable ' during his trial at @entity176 last month , @entity9 claimed the girl had invented their relationship , taking the novel @entity179 as a model			1
but the former vice-principal of @entity182 in south - east @entity183 was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust			1
jurors were told @entity9 , who taught @entity191 and ethics , took to carrying around a condom for use if the girl became ' too irresistible '			2

the teenager also claimed to have been in a car crash and wore bandages for weeks before teachers discovered she was lying			0
when confronted , she allegedly said : ' that 's what i do – i lie			0
' the judge said @entity9 had been in a position of ' emotional instability ' when they first had sex because his wife had just had a miscarriage			1
she added : ' the victim pursued you and had formed an attachment for you which was not something you had encouraged			0
her friends described her , accurately in my view , as stalking you			0
there is no doubt that she was obsessed with you			0
an obsession that she had harboured for a long time			0
' i saw no sign that you had encouraged [ the victim ] in any way			0
were it not for her obsession with you , the offence would never have @entity260 's a tragedy that somebody like you committed offences of this nature and now fall to be sentenced			2
' but she added : ' you are the responsible adult and it is up to you to show restraint			0
' affair : @entity9 , outside court yesterday , had sex with the 16 - year - old girl at his school in south - east @entity183 on a yoga mat and also at his family home when his wife was at work @entity35 's profile for @entity278 describes her as ' formidable ' ' cross me at your peril , ' warns the website of the judge who sentenced @entity9			1
@entity35 's profile for @entity278 also says : ' she is a formidable advocate who brooks no interference from a judge or anyone else in her direct approach on behalf of her clients			1
' the unmarried 64 - year - old has been a barrister for more than 40 years			0
she was called to the bar in 1972 , became a qc in 1994 and was made a circuit judge last july			0
she has forged something of a television career , appearing as prosecuting counsel in a murder case in a three - part @entity300 series , @entity301 , in 1996			0
more recently she featured in a rape trial in a four - parter , the verdict , again for the @entity300			0
but her real work is in the courtroom where she says she is ' often instructed in the more difficult and complex murder and sex cases which involve competing experts and their untested opinion '			0
on the website she lists her interests as skiing , scuba diving and travelling			0
she studied at @entity315 , @entity183 , after attending @entity316 and @entity317 in the capital			0

he claimed she had been able to describe his house accurately because she had seen pictures of it on his @entity334 @entity333			0
and he said she knew what underwear he wore because he had once changed for a panto and left his clothes on view			0
@entity339 , mitigating , said @entity9 's relationship with his ' devoted ' wife @entity42 had become stronger			2

his teaching contract was terminated in october			0
another campaigner , @entity355 of the @entity356 , described his suspended sentence as shocking			1
' what it says to me is that there 's a real lack of understanding about the nature of grooming , ' she added			0
' grooming is all about power dynamics			0
' in any case , the teacher definitely has a responsibility to say ' no ' , no matter how eager the child is			2
the criminal justice system needs to look more at the impact of this kind of thing – it involves a huge breach of trust			0
