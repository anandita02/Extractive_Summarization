a quarter of children in the @entity2 have never tasted a tomato and almost half have never tried lettuce			1
the shocking new statistics are a shameful insight into the daily diet of a child in the @entity2 - a country where the government has spent millions of pounds in advertising to push the @entity14 guidelines			1
ex-blue @entity16 presenter @entity15 saw the human side to these figures when she toured @entity2 's primary schools recently as part of a campaign to get children eating healthily			1
here she is pictured with children at @entity30 in @entity31 - one of the healthier schools from the programme the tv star was confronted with kids who believed boiled sweets counted as fruit and others who had never eaten a vegetable in their lives			1
she said : ' i was in a bubble of naivety before i started visiting these schools , i did not realise that three in ten kids have never had a banana or that four in ten kids have never had broccoli - you take that for granted			1
' @entity15 was taking part in the eat like a @entity54 programme , introduced to help tackle the growing issue of poor nutrition and inactive lifestyles among children			1
the project helps to teach children about eating healthily by tailor - making special lessons for children aged 9 - 10 that introduce fruit and vegetables into the diet			1
after taking the course to several primary schools , @entity15 realised that a large proportion of our population are being brought up without any access to vegetables			1
she said : ' this one little boy at school in @entity31 told me he only liked @entity78 , which is basically the west @entity31 equivalent of @entity80			0
@entity15 has been teaching children the value of eating healthily through the eat like a @entity54 programme ' he said he was eating it five times a week , which is not only expensive , it 's also just chicken in a bucket			1
at first he was adamant that he did n’t like healthy food and only liked @entity78 , but i just gave him some mango and suggested he try it			0
' it was n’t about me saying , " this is healthy - eat this , " i was more just saying , " try this			0
" ' by the end of the class he was having tomatoes and soft cheese on crackers , so i watched him change his mind			0
' with another little boy , i had to dare him to even get him to eat a blueberry			0
@entity15 first shot to fame on @entity108 children 's show @entity107			1
the @entity54 programme makes nutrition exciting for kids by encouraging them to adopt the choices of famous champions they admire ' by the end of the session i was watching him sneak handfuls of blueberries from behind our backs			0
' it 's hard for these kids because they have never even been given the option before			2
' it ’s about offering them tasty alternatives that also happen to be healthy			0
' while these accounts may seem shocking , the findings from the programme have shown that these children are n't alone			2
450,000 kids in @entity2 have never tried any fruit or vegetables in their lifetime			1
@entity15 says some of the children she spoke to believed that strawberry sweets counted towards their five a day 70 per cent of children have never eaten an aubergine or an avocado before , 42 per cent have never tasted a mushroom and 54 per cent have never tried celery			1
even more worryingly , many children believe that they are actually eating healthily because fruit - flavoured sweets count towards their five a day			2
@entity15 said : ' i don ‘ t think they realise what is a healthy choice is in a lot of cases			2
' @entity154 - so many kids think that counts , it ’s quite sad			0
' kids think that when they eat things like strawberry tarts , that ’s a great way to eat fruit when it most likely is n’t			2
' when i ’d ask if they helped to cook , they ’d say that they did help out in the kitchen , but not one of them mentioned fruit or vegetables			2
' they ’d have coco pops for breakfast and chicken curry for dinner			0
when i asked if they put onion in their chicken curry , they ’d even say no to that			0
' no kid said that they ate vegetables			0
' they even said that they take the lettuce out of their sandwiches , i mean , lettuce is just water			0
' the eat like a @entity54 programme , created by @entity190 in collaboration with the @entity192 is free for schools to sign up to .			0
