clinical trials of ' quack ' alternative medicines should be stopped because they are damaging and financially wasteful , two leading critics have said			1
@entity4 scientists , professor of surgery and oncology at @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 , an assistant professor in neurology at @entity12 , launched a scathing attack of treatments including aromatherapy , homeopathy and reiki			1
they condemned scientists who continue to carry out controlled experiments to discover whether the ' highly implausible treatments ' work			1
the pair brand homeopathy and reilki as ' faith healing ' , claiming clinical trials of the treatments have ' already been proved to have no benefits whatsoever ' , and ' merely lend them legitimacy and take money away from more deserving projects '			1
@entity4 scientists , professor of surgery and oncology at @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 , an assistant professor in neurology at @entity12 , have launched a scathing attack of treatments including aromatherapy , pictured , homeopathy and reiki , branding them ' quack treatments ' the article comes just weeks after conservative mp @entity39 praised the fact herbal remedies and healing were now becoming accepted in parts of the @entity44 , and called for astrology to be incorporated into the health service			1
professor @entity9 said : ' we hope this will be the first of many opportunities to discuss in the peer - reviewed literature the perils and pitfalls of doing clinical trials on treatment modalities that have already been refuted by basic science			1
' the two key examples in the article , homeopathy and reiki , are about as close to impossible from basic science considerations alone as you can imagine			2
' homeopathy involves diluting substances away to nothing and beyond , while reiki is in essence faith healing that substitutes eastern mysticism for @entity68 beliefs , as can be demonstrated by substituting the word ‘ god ’ for the ‘ universal source ’ that reiki masters claim to be able to tap into to channel their ‘ healing energy ’ into patients			1
' professor @entity75 argued clinical trials of such treatments would not change the minds of those who already practice them , but might make people who are tempted to try them believe they might actually work			2
he said : ' studying highly implausible treatments is a losing proposition			2
' such studies are unlikely to demonstrate benefit , and proponents are unlikely to stop using the treatment when the study is negative			0
the @entity4 critics , who claim reiki , pictured , is ' faith healing ' , said clinical trials into alternative medicine are ' damaging and a waste of money , diverting money from other projects ' ' such research only serves to lend legitimacy to otherwise dubious practices			1
' the professors , who run a blog about integrating science and medicine , have called for changes in the medical system to ensure doctors have the time to truly treat patients ' holistically ' by listening to them and taking account of their circumstances before prescribing them medicine			0
they argue this course will bring far more success than doctors offering patients treatments that claim to heal the body and mind but really have no success			2
professor @entity9 added : ' somehow this idea has sprung up that to be a ‘ holistic ’ doctor you have to embrace pseudoscience like homeopathy , reiki , traditional chinese medicine , and the like , but that ’s a false dichotomy			1
' if the medical system is currently too impersonal and patients are rushed through office visits because a doctor has to see more and more patients to cover his salary and expenses , then the answer is to find a way to fix those problems , not to embrace quackery			0
' integrating pseudoscience with science - based medicine is n’t going to make science - based medicine better			0
' one of our bloggers , @entity143 , has a fantastic saying for this : " if you mix cow pie with apple pie , it does not make the cow pie taste better ; it makes the apple pie worse "			0
professor @entity75 , said : ' such research only serves to lend legitimacy to otherwise dubious practices			1
' file picture of homeopathic medicine ' with cam or " integrative medicine " , that ’s exactly what we ’re doing , and these clinical trials of magic are just more examples of it			0
' professors @entity9 and @entity75 have also called on patients to use their own common sense when looking at the evidence to decide for themselves whether a treatment actually works or not			2
professor @entity9 added : ' critical thinking will help patients learn to recognize when a course of treatment is not supported by data or to tell when a health claim from any practitioner is just too good to be true			2
' the article was published in the journal trends in @entity182			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity184 , said : ' there is a growing grassroots demand for therapies such as reiki as people report significant improvements in their well - being			0
' this is backed up by a research database that , despite the lack of funding , is beginning to suggest benefits particularly in the arena of stress , depression and anxiety			0
increasing numbers of hospitals and hospice offer reiki for their patients - a snowballing effect due to patient demand and medical professionals observations			0
' the @entity208 has also approached @entity209 and the @entity210 for comment .			0

professor @entity9 of @entity8 and @entity10 from @entity12 launched a scathing attack on alternative medicines
condemned scientists who carry out experiments into ' quack treatments '
