with narrower shoulders , a slightly tapered waist and a more spacious seat , the unisex clothing line has been in the works since 2009			1
it is now being issued to all the @entity8 's installations - except for @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 - for women and also men with a smaller or more slender body			2
unlike the decades - old @entity8 combat uniform , which comes in 36 sizes and was designed principally by men for men , the alternate clothing line was created to fit a broader range of body types , officials say			1
the trousers feature wider areas at the hips , waist and backside ; elastic around the waistband instead of pull string ; adjusted pockets and knee - pad inserts ; and a shortened rise in pants			0
the jackets include adjusted rank and name tape positioning , adjusted pockets and elbow - pad inserts , slimmer shoulders , a thinner and more fitted waist , and a longer and wider coat bottom			2
also , buttons are replacing the fabric fastener pockets			0
according to a 2008 @entity8 focus group report , ' unisex ' combat uniforms designed for men fit many women badly in the shoulders , bust , hips and crotch			1
these deficiencies left many buying sizes that were too large			0
the @entity8 designed a solution and had 400 active - duty and 200 @entity75 and @entity76 female soldiers fit - test the line in 2011			1

roughly one in every six @entity9 soldiers is a woman and , last month , the @entity8 announced that the ratio likely will increase by early 2014 , when the service will continue its efforts to open all closed units and military occupational specialities to women			1
in 2012 , the @entity8 opened 14,000 positions in closed units to female soldiers , and this year , senior leadership has signalled its intent to open an additional 6,000 infantry , armour and field artillery positions before accepting female applicants into reconnaissance , surveillance , and targeting and acquisition battalions			2
ready for action : the jackets include adjusted rank and name tape positioning , adjusted pockets and elbow - pad inserts , slimmer shoulders , a thinner and more fitted waist , and a longer and wider coat bottom the uniform changes : according to a 2008 @entity8 focus group report , the old ' unisex ' combat fit many women badly in the shoulders , bust , hips and crotch			1
these deficiencies left many buying larger sizes the @entity8 is planning to develop gender - neutral standards to ensure all soldiers have fair access to jobs			2
beginning in july 2014 , the @entity8 will open military occupational specialities within its engineer branch then follow up with positions in its field artillery , armour and infantry branches			0
the changes will lead to more than 116,800 new opportunities for women in the @entity8			0
