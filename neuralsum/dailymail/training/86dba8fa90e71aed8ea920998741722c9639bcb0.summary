by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 4 september 2013 across the fields and hedgerows around my @entity5 home , bees are buzzing , crickets are chirping , and gathering swallows are twittering in the skies			0
@entity11 ’s season of mists and mellow fruitfulness — autumn — is with us once again			2
after last year ’s washout summer , followed by a chilly winter and one of the coolest and latest springs on record , our wildlife is bouncing back			1
pick your own : three young blackberry pickers in @entity23 , who have evidently sampled some of the fruit in my own garden , in the lee of the @entity29 , nature is thriving			0
the trees and bushes are dripping with fruit : green cider apples , ripening blackberries , and deep purple clumps of elderberries contrast with the gaudy crimson of the hawthorn			0
this free food supply attracts a constant stream of birds : from clumsy wood pigeons and perky blackbirds , to delicate little warblers such as the blackcap and lesser whitethroat , all gorging themselves on nature ’s bounty from dawn to dusk			2
in the old barn next door , the swallows are raising their second brood of young — in a race against time before the chill winds of october begin to blow , reducing the supply of flying insects they need to feed their hungry chicks			0
meanwhile , in the clear blue skies overhead , the youngsters from the swallows ’ previous brood are testing out their flying skills			0
this is vital , as very soon they will be heading south on the 5,000 - mile journey to their winter home , near the southern tip of @entity73			2
for month after month at the start of the year we waited in vain for spring to arrive then , just as we were beginning to think the weather would never change , summer arrived with a bang and for the first time in years , there are clouds of butterflies : the common or garden whites alongside small tortoiseshells , peacocks and red admirals			1
many are feasting on fallen fruit , and becoming tipsy as they drink the fermenting juices of our apples , pears and plums			0
all these wild creatures are benefiting from one of the most bizarre years on record , weather-wise			0
for month after month at the start of the year we waited in vain for spring to arrive			1
a cold february was followed by an even colder march , with bitter north - easterly winds blowing straight from @entity100			0
april showers failed to materialise , as winter seemed to go on for ever , in the coldest and latest spring for more than 50 years			1
after last year 's disastrous wet summer , there were fears that some grassland butterflies such as the @entity106 ( pictured ) and chalkhill blues would be in big trouble this year then , just as we were beginning to think the weather would never change , summer arrived with a bang			1
the first ten days of june were glorious , and the fine , sunny weather continued — especially in @entity113 — throughout july and august			1
so how has nature responded to this unusual weather ? classic signs of spring were long delayed : hawthorn blossom , bumblebees , and early butterflies such as the orange - tip all emerged weeks later than usual , while garden songsters such as the song thrush stayed silent well into the new year			1
after last year ’s disastrous wet summer , there were fears that some grassland butterflies such as the @entity106 and chalkhill blues would be in big trouble this year			1
yet a one - hour count of chalkhill blues near @entity130 in @entity131 produced an incredible 3,200 butterflies — smashing the previous record of 825 from 2006			0
this is because of the prolonged spell of fine , warm weather we enjoyed during the key time for these beautiful insects to emerge , in july and august			2
@entity140 , of @entity141 , points out that the current spell of fine weather is good news for butterflies that spend the winter as hibernating adults , such as the comma , peacock and small tortoiseshell			1
and in @entity152 , the @entity151 has enjoyed a bonanza of meadow brown and ringlet butterflies , both of which suffered badly from last year ’s summer holiday washout			1
they believe that this year ’s late spring snowfalls meant that these butterflies hatched far later than usual , again coinciding with the long period of warm , settled weather in late may and june			1
the copious crop of berries this autumn is also down to the cold , late spring			1
plants such as hawthorn , crab apple and rowan delayed flowering for weeks because of the chilly weather ; so when warm , sunny conditions finally arrived they were able to take advantage			1
the copious crop of berries this autumn is also down to the cold , late spring oaks also flowered late , ensuring a bumper yield of acorns across much of @entity113			1
blackberries are several weeks behind schedule , but unless we get a spell of very wet weather we are due a huge crop			2
but bear in mind the old country saying that the devil ‘ spits on blackberries ’ on @entity188 at the end of this month ( september 29 ) , rendering them inedible			0
naturalists are talking of a ‘ mast year ’ — one in which trees produce lots of ‘ mast ’ ( the fruit of beech , oak , chestnut , and other woodland trees )			2
this is very good news for those creatures that rely on fruits , nuts and berries to get them through the autumn and winter			0
red squirrels and jays do n’t just feast on acorns , but also bury them in special hiding places to provide food in the lean times ahead			0
later on in the autumn , birds such as the fieldfare and redwing — thrushes that breed in @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity100 — will arrive here in their millions			0
if the berry crop is as good as has been predicted , they will enjoy the benefits of this long , hot summer well into the winter ahead			2
but as with any period of unusual weather , 2013 has n’t been a vintage year for all wildlife			1
@entity231 nature guru @entity230 has noticed precious few hazelnuts , which is very bad news for dormice , and beechnuts are also at a low ebb			0
other gardeners are reporting a remarkable lack of aphids — good news for rose - growers , but very bad news for one of our favourite insects , the ladybird			0
so does the proliferation of fruits and berries foretell a hard winter , as many people believe ? despite a wealth of ancient folklore and proverbs linking a good year for berries with a hard winter ahead , there is no evidence the two are connected			2
as @entity230 points out , the big harvest reflects what has gone , not what ’s to come			0
what we can be sure of is that 2014 is likely to produce even more weather surprises for both us and for @entity113 ’s wildlife .			1

after last year ’s washout summer , followed by a chilly winter and late spring , our wildlife is bouncing back
2014 is likely to produce even more weather surprises for both us and for @entity113 ’s wildlife
