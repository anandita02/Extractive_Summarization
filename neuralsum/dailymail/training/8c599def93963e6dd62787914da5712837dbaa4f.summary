but the majority are just lonely and want someone to talk to			2
' the older men tend to stay on the phone longer for general conversation and some smutty talk while the younger men call for relief			0
' secret role : @entity0 , not her real name , loves the fact nobody knows about her evening work for a sex line @entity0 said nobody knows her secret profession and her friends and family would be shocked if they knew how she 's spending her evenings			1

@entity94 fetishes : @entity0 said the requests she gets from callers never ceases to amaze her she said : ' there is no script , i follow the lead of the people who call and what they want - which are sometimes things i could never have imagined			1
