by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 18:31 est , 12 october 2012 a family with seven children who are facing eviction from their foreclosed home say they have found the money to buy it back - but the bank is refusing to sell it until it has heard other potential offers			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , claim the bank wants them to leave the house as it would grant them five days in which to accept outside offers , potentially profiting from the family 's loss should someone offer more			1
' my family wants to buy our family farm of many years - but because we are in foreclosure , @entity22 ( the servicer ) and @entity24 ( the trustee ) , two of the largest banks in the @entity28 , are refusing to even hear an offer until we have been evicted , ' mrs @entity21 wrote in a @entity36 petition			1
losing their home : the gearing family of @entity12 , whose seven children are pictured , are in a battle with the banks after offering to buy back their foreclosed home from the bank but refused until other offers are received mrs @entity21 added that her seven children , ages seven to 17 , and their aunt , who suffers from alzheimer 's disease , all live in the her five - bedroom , custom - built home			1
' my husband did very well , ' mrs gearing , 42 , told @entity51 of their 5,500 - square - foot home they took a $ 1.4 million mortgage out on in 2006			2
' we worked very hard , obviously			0
we 're just victims of the economy just like everyone else			0
it affected everybody on all levels , ' she said			0
with the recession cutting her husband 's earnings to a quarter of what he previously made , and finding themselves unable to make their near $ 7,000 monthly mortgage payments - despite the mother now working as a house keeper as well as a substitute teacher - the couple filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in february of 2011			2
five months later in july , their house was foreclosed			0
' my husband started packing when we were notified of the foreclosure , ' she said			0
' i did n't give up			0
' make an offer : a family friend has since offered to buy their house for them for $ 300,000 after comparing the retail price of surrounding homes , but their bank says they 'd rather wait on another offer ( file photo ) a family friend came to their rescue earlier this year , offering to purchase the home at its current market value so they 'd be able to remain living in it			1
over time , they promised to pay this friend back			1
mrs @entity21 said the gesture was an overwhelmingly hopeful one with the family unable to imagine finding another home or apartment large enough to house them all			2
the family friend , who wished not to be named , made a cash offer to @entity24 for the house for $ 300,000 - a figure which was found by comparing the surrounding homes ' current selling price			1
yet @entity24 , despite being listed on their foreclosure , said they did n't own the property and were just one of several financial firms that possessed it			0
it prompted what the family has now called a ' run - around , ' connecting @entity22 to the foreclosure as well			2
' we have tried tirelessly to work with the bank to keep our home , but have been given the run - around by the bank each time - often calling and being forwarded to scores of representatives , none of which say they can do anything to negotiate ! ' mrs @entity21 writes with her petition that has received nearly 200,000 signatures of support			1
' now , we have managed to find outside financing and are trying to submit an offer to @entity22 to buy back our home ( in cash ) ... but @entity22 , claiming bureaucratic process , is refusing to even hear or consider offers on the property until we have been evicted			1
' ' in servicing a property , we follow the investors ' guidelines to avoid foreclosure when possible and to minimize the loss in the case of foreclosure , ' @entity140 said in a statement to @entity51			0
' after foreclosure , we seek to sell the home for fair market value			0
' while possibly unable to offer much more for the home if asked by the bank , the family say there has been some good news as @entity22 sent a real estate agent to assess the home 's value on thursday			1
on tuesday of next week , an appraiser is set to visit as well			0
the news could n't home faster for the family as the november 5 eviction date looms			2
if it does go through , the family said they will still try and buy the home back but do not want to have to move out and then move back in again			1
' just to do that and move back in ? for what reason ? red tape ? ' she said			0
mrs @entity21 says she has since started looking at apartments in the area so her children can continue to attend their schools			0
asked if the family 's friend would be willing to pay more for the property , mrs @entity21 said they 'd pay only what she called a ' fair ' price .			2

@entity9 and @entity10 ' tried offering their bank cash for their five - bedroom home but it has been refused '
a family friend offered to buy the home and they can pay him back
if forced to *vacate* next month the family of 10 - *including* an aunt in their care - believe it will give the bank time to find a *higher* *bidder* on their home
