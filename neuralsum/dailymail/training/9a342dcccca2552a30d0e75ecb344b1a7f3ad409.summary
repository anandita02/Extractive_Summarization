dr @entity6 , left , who has been forced to hand over his £ 2million @entity3 townhouse to his ex-wife @entity14 , right , in a divorce battle after he tried to hide his true wealth it led to the couple 's former matrimonial home , a £ 2million five - bed house in affluent @entity27 , west @entity3 being handed to his ex-wife			1
dr @entity16 appealed claiming the result was that his ex-wife had received more than her fair share of the family ’s £ 3million - plus fortune			1
but his case was thrown out by @entity36 judge @entity35 , who said dr @entity16 had taken the risk of concealing his financial affairs and lost			1
he said : ‘ there has been a wholesale failure by the husband to provide any meaningful disclosure in the proceedings			0
‘ a husband who chooses to approach the litigation in the way this husband did has to run the risk of inferences being drawn against him			0
’ dr @entity16 separated from his wife in 2012 after a 14 - year marriage , during which they had three children , all now of school age			2
battle : the fight was over this £ 2m house in @entity27 , west @entity3 , which was awarded to dr @entity16 's ex-wife he had worked as an engineer for @entity64 , but took early retirement in 1998 and set up a consultancy , and later the business , @entity68 but when the divorce reached court last year , he refused to reveal full details of the company ’s dealings outside of the @entity74			1
his barrister , @entity75 , admitted at the @entity76 that although dr @entity16 had disclosed the business in the @entity74 , he ‘ did not disclose ’ its more profitable work in the @entity78			2
criticising dr @entity16 as a witness in october last year , the family judge , judge @entity79 , said she was ‘ fully sceptical about his reliability ’			1
she said the business was ‘ substantial ’ and held sizeable assets in offshore accounts			0
but appealing today , mr @entity84 argued that there was insufficient evidence on which judge @entity79 could find that there was more money which dr @entity16 could lay his hands on			0
mr @entity84 said : ‘ the judge ’s order did not produce an equal , or even broadly equal , division of the family resources			0
' but rejecting his case , @entity35 said dr @entity16 ’s ‘ stoic non-disclosure ’ had left his ex-wife ’s lawyers ‘ painstakingly putting together a jigsaw puzzle ’ to get to the bottom of what his true assets were			1
the case was thrown out at the @entity76 by judge @entity35 , who said dr @entity16 had taken the risk of concealing his financial affairs and lost he said : ‘ it is entirely proper for a court facing stoic non-disclosure such as this to consider drawing adverse inferences against the party failing to come clean			2
’ he rejected dr @entity16 ’s appeal bid and refused him permission to challenge the order that he pay £ 140,000 towards his ex-wife ’s legal costs of the case			2
speaking afterwards , mrs @entity16 said : ‘ the decision by the @entity76 to uphold the judgment reinforces the faith that i have always had that there is real justice for everyone in this country			0
‘ i feel that i have been treated fairly by the court , given everything that i have been through over recent years			0
’ her solicitor @entity128 , of family law firm @entity129 , said : ‘ pivotal to this case was the husband ’s actions in trying to conceal the extent of his wealth from the court and his wife			0
‘ in doing so , dr @entity16 has not only wasted a significant amount of judicial and court time – a valuable resource ; in addition he has shown himself to be contemptuous of the very process which is designed to deliver a fair decision in such proceedings			0
‘ in dismissing his appeal and upholding the heavy costs penalty , the court has given a strong message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated			0
