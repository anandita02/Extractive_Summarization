the summer transfer window in @entity1 may be closed until the new year but there are still plenty of stars who are free to a good home			1
these unattached players can be picked up at any time and plenty of @entity10 clubs will have their eyes on a bargain			1
@entity14 , for instance , still have room for two non-homegrown players to be added to their 25 - man squad so @entity18 may yet look to add to it , with experienced defender @entity20 potentially worth a punt			1
the @entity38 left @entity39 in the summer after 14 years , winning a host of trophies including six @entity43 titles and three champions @entity44			0
the 32 - year - old , who earlier in the summer failed a medical at @entity48 due to a serious knee injury , is being strongly linked with a move to @entity51 and could end up there on a one - year deal			2
a possible spanner in the works is that he wo n't be fit until december			0
shot stopper : @entity33 established himself as one of the top keepers in the world during his time at @entity39 @entity29 despite his advancing years , who would n't want to see the magical @entity62 in the @entity10 for one last hurrah ? the former @entity64 winner is without a club since leaving @entity66 in july , and has been linked with a move to @entity68 all summer as well as a host of other clubs from the newly - formed @entity71			1
the 34 - year - old remains a free agent though and we all still hope to see those silky skills and that toothy smile in @entity1 's top flight before he does eventually call it a day			1
@entity79 : @entity29 , two - time world player of the year , still has plenty of skills in his locker @entity20 @entity83 may be 38 now but he is showing no signs of slowing up just yet after playing every minute at the @entity85 , where he captained @entity87 to the quarter - finals			1
he predictably has a wealth of experience after spells with @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 but after leaving @entity96 side @entity95 at the end of last season he is now a free agent and is reportedly keen on a move to @entity1			2
with @entity14 a defender or two light , @entity18 could do a lot worse than offer @entity104 a short - term deal as he still seems more than capable of performing at the highest level			1
experience : @entity20 could be an excellent addition to @entity18 's squad for the long season ahead @entity111 the former @entity113 striker left @entity114 in the summer after three years in @entity115 , scoring 25 goals in the process			1
he has already attracted interest from newly - promoted @entity119 this summer , as well as @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity111 , still only 30 , could prove to be a useful addition to a mid-table @entity10 side and comes with minimal risk too			1
pedigree : @entity111 is only 30 but he has amassed a lot of experience in the game at the highest level @entity131 the experienced @entity133 defender is without a club after leaving @entity135 earlier this summer			1
the 33 - year - old joined the club from @entity93 last summer , but the @entity135 triggered a break clause to let him go halfway through his two - year contract			0
@entity131 appeared for his country during the @entity85 in @entity141 so could prove to be a useful squad addition for a club battling against relegation			0
he has , however , been linked with a move to serie a side @entity146			0
determined : @entity131 is looking to get his career back on track after an indifferent spell at @entity135 @entity150 the @entity62 striker terminated his contract at @entity153 on monday after three years with the club and the 30 - year - old should now have a number of interested suitors			2
@entity150 scored 10 goals in all competitions last season , including an eight minute hat - trick against @entity162 in the league			0
capped 11 times by his country , @entity150 still has plenty to offer at the highest level so it wo n't be to long before he gets a new club , with the @entity10 potentially in sight for him			1
quality : @entity150 would be a very shrewd acquisition for a number of @entity10 sides @entity176 the @entity141 forward has been in the @entity178 playing for the last two years but is now available on a free transfer after his @entity181 contract was cancelled by mutual consent earlier this summer			1
he was a star during his time at @entity184 alongside the likes of @entity186 , proving he has what it takes to compete at the top			0
@entity176 also has a decent track record on the international stage netting nine times in his 23 appearances for his country			0
could be worth a go			0
reputable : @entity176 still has plenty to offer at the highest level @entity197 the experienced right back was with @entity199 last season after joining on a free transfer in november			1
the 34 - year - old spent 10 years in the all - conquering @entity204 side ( domestically , at least ) , and had spells at @entity153 and @entity206			0
despite his advancing years he could still do a job for a mid-table / lower @entity10 side , with his five @entity211 title triumphs with @entity204 proving he has the quality and mindset to succeed at the highest level			2
top drawer : @entity197 has proved to be a very consistent player for club and country in his career @entity219 the experienced @entity221 winger knows the @entity10 well following his time at @entity223 and was last with @entity224			1
the 34 - year - old spent six years at @entity226 making more than 150 appearances and he finished on a high in the dramatic 2012 @entity229 win over @entity230			0
@entity119 have reportedly been offered the wideman , who would bring versatility and experience to many a @entity10 squad			1
@entity237 fancy : @entity219 could still do a job for most @entity10 sides @entity240 despite a disappointing spell on loan at @entity243 last season as the @entity243 were relegated , @entity240 has plenty of @entity10 nous			2
the former @entity248 captain spent nine years at @entity249 , featuring in over 200 @entity10 matches , before moving to @entity251 champions @entity250 in 2012			2
the 33 - year - old is now available on a free transfer after departing @entity251 in the summer and newly - promoted sides could do a lot worse			2
rock at the back : @entity240 was a fans ' favourite during his time at @entity249 and still has plenty to offer @entity261 at 33 @entity261 is by no means a long - term option but will bring much - needed experience and leadership to any of the struggling sides			0
the left back spent five years at @entity120 in two separate spells - he was released by the @entity120 in the summer - and also captained @entity121			0
any @entity10 club would have to move quickly , however , as the former @entity269 defender is in talks with @entity272 side @entity271			2
experience : @entity261 has made around 200 @entity10 appearances during his career @entity276 @entity276 is the kind of old - fashioned , chalk - on - his - boots winger who could provide attacking options for a few @entity10 clubs , even at 33			1
he left @entity281 at the end of last season but as of yet has failed to find a new club			0
after joining the @entity285 for £ 2million from @entity120 in january 2009 , @entity276 became a firm fans favourite at the @entity287 , making over 150 @entity10 appearances during his five - year stint at the club , scoring in an @entity292 semi-final			2
old - fashioned winger : @entity276 likes nothing more than to beat a full back and put in a cross @entity297 another player who has left @entity281 this year , @entity297 has plenty of baggage but also lots of ability			0
he has reportedly be seeing a sports psychologist in order to help get his attitude right and get his career back on track			0
@entity297 was reportedly also set for a move to @entity310 outfit @entity199 earlier this summer in a move which would have seen him link up with his former @entity51 boss @entity313 , under whom he flourised and played in a @entity229 final , but that failed to materialise			0
ability : @entity297 is still more than capable of playing in @entity1 's top flight @entity318 : @entity318 was an ever - present for @entity319 before being released at the end of last season			2
the former @entity323 stopper performed admirably down at the @entity324 as the @entity325 reached the @entity327 play - offs in successive years			0
the 32 - year - old would be a good no 2 for many clubs in the @entity10			1
highly rated : @entity318 is keen on a move to the @entity10 after leaving @entity319 @entity332 @entity332 never started a league game during his three years at @entity14 but , seeing as he is still only 29 the @entity335 forward would be open to the idea of another chance to impress in the @entity10			1
a newly - promoted side may take a punt on the former @entity341 and @entity342 loanee , who does have a decent goalscoring record at international level - with 24 goals in 65 appearances			0
talented : @entity348 failed to impress at @entity14 but may want another opportunity to impress in the @entity10 the following are also still available ... @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 & @entity361			1
to find the full list of free agents around the country go to the @entity366 's official website .			1

@entity33 , @entity29 and @entity20 are the top free agents on the *market* following the *deadline* day drama
despite the transfer window closing on monday night clubs are still able to add unattached players to their 25 - man squad list if they have room to do so
@entity14 could still be on the lookout for a defender with experienced @entity381 @entity104 potentially filling the bill
@entity111 is another name who could end up in the @entity10
