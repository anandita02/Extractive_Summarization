by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 09:24 est , 7 january 2014 getting and staying fit is one of the most declared - and broken - pledges of the @entity5			2
but for those determined to stick to the resolution of a healthier lifestyle , @entity6 has teamed up with international rugby star @entity10 to make sure your plan lasts longer than your first trial month at the gym			1
although the recipe has n’t changed – eating smart and working out are still the only way to bake a healthy body - there are many , many of ways to get the result you are looking for , no matter where you are in life			1
get fit like a pro : for rugby player @entity10 , staying fit is a full - time occupation - so he knows his stuff starting you off : warm - up is key			1
if you are a member of a gym , foam rollers are readily available , and can be purchased in a sports shop or online			2
however , a rugby / american football ball for the main muscles and a golf ball to target trigger points are great alternatives			2
it is not painless , especially if you often run straight into a workout without warming up , but as it helps increase blood flow and warm up the muscle tissue it is a worthwhile practice to incorporate into your workout routine			1
ten rolls back and forward on your main muscle groups ( back , calves , glutes , quads and hamstrings ) and your body will thank you			2
they see me rollin : using foam rollers is an excellent way to get your muscles warm before a workout all fired up : a good ten rolls back and forward on each muscle group will ensure that you are ready to start your workout and avoid straining your muscles ' these warm up techniques can be used at any age , a lot of people go in to the gym , especially when you are young , do n't warm up properly and go straight into lifting , ' @entity10 says			1
' you do n't need to be there for hours , you do n't need to be a yoga master , what you need to do is to get your body into a good position to lift , so that no matter what you do , whether it is a bench press or a squat , your body is in line and your muscles are n't sleeping			2
' below , @entity10 has put together exercises which can be adapted to your goal , whether it is to get fit or get fitter , no matter where you are in life			1
he says that 2014 is the year to be inspired by our childhood , no matter our age			0
' if working out becomes a chore , it will never last longer than the end of the month , so make it playful and fun			0
' these exercises are supposed to be about accessibility , they work for everyone , especially for women			2
' many women fear that lifting weights is going to make them bulky , but that is never going to be the case			0
' if you have limited space and time , a kettlebell and some rubberbands will get you a long way			0
' kettleball overhead lift : hold two kettlebells as @entity10 is showing in the picture and lift both arms high medicine ball abdominal 1 : sit on the floor with your feet lifted , hold the medicine ball or equivalent with both hands and lift it from side to side , touching the floor on each side kettlebell swing : create a stable base with your legs at shoulder width , ' ass to the grass ' , clench your abdominal muscles and swing the kettlebell from between your legs and out as you stand up @entity128 for many , our 20s and early 30s are about forging a career , building a social network and navigating romantic pitfalls			1
but this is also the time when we build a base upon which our fitness can rest when our lives are less self - centred			0
when getting your cardio in , channel your inner 80s kid and get back on your wheels			0
roller skating or long - boarding is a different way of pounding the pavement when you feel like mixing up your jogging			0
@entity10 says : ' rollerblading again will work your leg muscles and depending on for how long and how fast you go , you will build some body conditioning too			1
‘ late 30s and 40s stereotypically , our late 30s and 40s is a time involving focus on family , partners and children , turning life into less ‘ heels and cocktails ’ and more ‘ walking boots and milk bottles ’			2
hours in the gym are exchanged for weekends spent in the park , which @entity10 says is a perfect opportunity to fit in some training time			1
get your old skipping rope from the attic and even a few minutes will raise your pulse			0
if you have a partner , get together and incorporate interval training and body weight exercises such as using a park bench for step - ups and dips and burpees and lizard crawls to keep your heart rate up			0
medicineball abdominal 2 : lie down on your back and hold the medicine ball over your head medicineball abdominal 2 : sit up , bringing the ball over your head , and slam it into the ground as you come down with your arms with your legs at shoulder width , hold the medicine ball at chest level			0
squat holding the ball and as you come back to an upright position , throw the ball as high as you against the wall , and catch it on the way back @entity10 says : ‘ @entity193 works your legs , your calves , your quads as well as your cardiovascular system			1
it ’s a great exercise widely used by many sports people , requiring an entire body hit of conditioning			0
’ in your 30s and 40s , focus should move from pure fitness to more mobility exercises in order to stay fit and healthy as you age			0
@entity207 , @entity208 , and @entity209 increasingly independent children means time to enjoy adult life again , but if you want to maintain your health , it is important to continue to exercise , even if it is at a slower pace			2
@entity10 says : ‘ an hour ’s walk over different gradients will raise the heart rate and help to burn off some of calories			1
just make sure you have the appropriate supportive footwear and clothing on when you do so			0
’ @entity10 recommends adding a training supplement to get the best results from your fitness routine 2014			1
' getting the result you want is about training hard , training well , eating smart and ensuring you get a proper recovery process , ' he says			0
no surprises then that @entity10 put his own expertise to the test to create @entity233 and @entity234 pre-trainer and fatburner supplements			1
@entity233 ( for men ) and @entity234 ( for women ) was created by @entity10 when he struggled to find supplements that he as a professional athlete could safely take			1
@entity233 , @entity238 and @entity10 ' own @entity239 are available on @entity240 even 10 - 15 minutes of daily body weight routines such as squats and abdominal exercises will see your health improve within weeks			1
' using a rubber band to stretch is particularly good when you have been working a long time and you may have problems with your back or legs , and they are easy to pick up online , ' @entity10 says			1
' overhead dislocation sounds horrific , but it 's not			0
holding a rubber band at chest level and stretching it out over your head , behind your back opens up your chest			0
' ' even if you can not fit in going to the gym , a lot of exercises with bands and medicine balls is easy to do anywhere , even in your front room			0
' ' there is a difference between training , which is what you do in the early part in your life , when you are looking to get in shape , lose weight and perform , and exercising which is in the later part of your life when focus is on maintaining a healthy living			1
' thanks to @entity278 .			0
