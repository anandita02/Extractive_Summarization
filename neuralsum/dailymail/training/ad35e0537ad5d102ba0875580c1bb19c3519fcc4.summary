it 's one of the most glamorous - but undoubtedly one of the most hit - and - miss - nights on the fashion calendar			1
and leading the worst - dressed list at the @entity4 in @entity5 on monday was pop star @entity6 , with actresses @entity7 and @entity9 hot on her gold gladiator - style heels			1
@entity6 wore a champagne - coloured dress with puffy lace skirt - split to the waist to expose her underwear - by @entity16 , paired with questionable thigh - high , golden strappy heels			1
designer @entity23 describes the gown as an , ' antiqued matte gold sequined silk tulle gown with an asymmetrical sculpted train			1
' however , most were unconvinced by the ensemble			0
her footwear - custom @entity34 embroidered with antique gold sequins - looked out of place and over-the - top on her busy outfit			0
strike a pose : @entity7 's current @entity42 @entity41 cover is world 's away from the less - than - desirable @entity46 outfit she wore to the @entity4 on monday night in need of some educating , @entity6 ? @entity6 made the cardinal mistake of flashing her smalls in the garish @entity23 gown @entity52 : she tried to cover up when she realised her blunder but it was too little far too late ticking all the boxes : if @entity6 's beau @entity57 is pleased at her plunging neckline and daring skirt split , he 's possibly the only fan meanwhile , @entity7 's saloon waitress look - a dress by @entity46 - had @entity63 users aghast			1
style bloggers @entity64 asked : ' we need to talk about @entity7 's milkmaid by way of the saloon			2
' @entity7 , who is currently on the cover of @entity41 , is known for her voluptuous figure			2
but it was flanked by the mountain of material that made up her outfit , not to mention the bizarre frills and corset which featured on the black lace dress			2
losing her @entity6 : @entity6 's huge fashion fail may make her reputation even less squeaky clean than it was before doomed from the start : passers - by could tell this would be a fashion disaster even before @entity7 made it onto the red carpet who put her up to this ? @entity7 's disastrous frock is seen in public for the first time as she heads to the ball this is n't a saloon bar ! @entity7 resembled a buxom waitress as she arrived at the @entity4 on monday in @entity46 the @entity4 , formally called the @entity4 , is an annual fundraising gala for the benefit of the @entity98 's @entity4 , and is renowned for attracting fashion 's most famous faces			1
however , in spite of it 's reputation as the most stylish night of the year , some guests still manage to get it wrong			0
@entity9 , usually preened to perfection , looked more like @entity107 from @entity109 's @entity108 , in a huge yellow @entity111 gown			0
the actress looked disheveled in the mustard - coloured dress , in which the puffy shoulders fell down onto her slim shoulders			1
at least she ditched @entity117 ! @entity9 ' attempt to be the @entity119 , in @entity109 - style yellow @entity111 , falls flat what was she thinking ? @entity9 ' dress seemed too big as it fell down around her slender frame also doing the walk of shame on the red carpet was @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 in @entity129 and @entity130 , whose @entity133 taffeta sculpted skirt drowned her pretty figure			2
@entity135 was another contender for the worst - dressed star to grace the @entity4 's red carpet			1
the @entity139 actress , 22 , wore an ill - fitting @entity141 dress which fell unflatteringly down the shoulders and aged her dramatically			2
@entity143 , meanwhile wore a bizarre dress , also by @entity141 , with the @entity145 from @entity146 printed upon it			0
rock on ! @entity148 pulls a pose in her questionable @entity141 gown , next to @entity143 , also in @entity141 well hello : @entity135 , left , and @entity143 , right , both wear @entity152 designer @entity141 on the @entity4 's red carpet , but the verdict on their outfits is a resounding fail @entity141 twins ! both @entity143 , left and @entity135 , right with @entity143 , wore the @entity152 designer for @entity161 's sake ! @entity128 's @entity129 gown , left , gets the fashion thumbs down , whilst @entity126 , right , also gets it oh so wrong in her @entity127 strapless silk dress keeping things quirky on the carpet were @entity169 in a overly frilly @entity171 dress and @entity172 in an odd @entity174 gown			2
@entity175 wore @entity176 to the star - studded event , but even the @entity152 design powerhouse did n't suit the pretty actress			0
her dress was far too busy for the usually elegant star , with feathers and a chiffon skirt paired with a heavily sequined long - sleeved top			2
fashion fail ! @entity175 looked uncomfortable in this @entity176 gown dressed to un-impress : @entity175 pictured leaving her hotel in @entity5 in her @entity176 number , right , and arriving at the @entity4 's red carpet , left what were they thinking ? both @entity192 , in @entity193 , left , and @entity130 , in @entity133 , right did the walk of fashion shame at the @entity4 on monday keeping it quirky : @entity169 went overboard with frills in @entity171 , left , while @entity172 's pop of bright lime colour in her @entity174 gown did her no favours also on the worst dressed list were usually on - trend @entity203 , actress @entity204 , model @entity205 and @entity207			1
@entity205 wore an over-the - top @entity208 from the outdated spring / summer 2011 collection , paired with a reported $ 1 million worth of @entity212 diamonds			0
21 jump street actress @entity204 , 24 , wore enviable designer @entity214 , though the outfit was bizarre : garish gold trousers and an oversized tunic which made her look more like a @entity219 decoration than a guest at a high fashion event			0
@entity207 , meanwhile , an @entity223 investor , former hedge fund manager , and socialite , wore a bright yellow dress which clashed heavily with her pale skin and stark two - tone hair scraped back			2
@entity205 wears a bizarre @entity111 gown to the @entity4 too much ! model @entity230 wore a huge @entity111 ballgown with @entity212 diamond jewellery @entity234 ! actress @entity204 does n't earn her fashion stripes with this unflattering trouser suit actress @entity204 , 24 , makes it onto the worst - dressed list of the @entity4 gala , with this @entity214 number blooming awful : @entity203 looked older than her years in this peach dress and slightly odd hair style something funny ? @entity207 's garish yellow dress is highly unflattering not so green with envy : actress @entity245 went for an emerald green @entity214 outfit that was overcrowded with embroidery on the other end of the fashion spectrum however , were @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 , who looked sensational in their outfits			1
