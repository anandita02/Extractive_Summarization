a three - bedroom semi detached house was rented for up to £ 40,000 a year by rogue landlords despite having a tree poking through the wall in one of its rooms			1
the property in @entity9 , south @entity10 , is among a handful which slipped through the hands of @entity14 council in the 1970s when local authorities did not have enough money to refurbish them			1
passed on to housing associations and cooperatives , it eventually fell into the hands of a rogue landlord who has illegally extended the property into the garden , failing to chop down a large tree			2
worryingly the landlord , who has not been named by authorities , used the tree 's branches as a router for electricity for its eight tenants			0
council officials discovered that a property in @entity9 , south @entity10 , had been extended around a tree in its back garden which landlords failed to chop down when expanding , instead opting to use its branches to route electricity the ' appalling ' conditions were discovered by the council when officials visited the site to take back ownership of the run - down house			1
' the conditions the people in this illegal @entity47 were living in were truly appalling , and represented a genuine danger to life and limb , ' said councillor @entity51			0
' it is shocking that someone can make money exploiting people by illegally renting out such dangerous accommodation with no regard for the safety of the people living there			0
' we have 21,000 people on our housing waiting list , 1,800 families in temporary accommodation , and 1,300 families who are severely overcrowded			0
' with this housing need , it would be irresponsible to spend our money refurbishing shortlife properties which are in a very poor state of disrepair – particularly when they are being misused for these exploitative and illegal purposes			0
' the house , which has been illegally converted into flats , had only one bathroom with a single bath and filthy toilet for occupants to share			2
it is located on a quiet residential street in south @entity10 where the average property costs £ 715,000			2
experts estimated the property in a leafy , residential street , was earning landlords up to £ 40,000 a year by renting each of the rooms out each of the tiny rooms was being rented individually , it is thought , for around £ 100 a week			2
originally the property was a three - bedroom house officials found spare mattresses , wood shavings and cardboard boxes scattered around the property when they turned up to repossess it a disused microwave , ladder , chairs and scraps of wood lie in the house 's garden for council officials to clear up after it was vacated the only bathroom in the run - down property had just one filthy toilet and grubby bath for all eight of its occupants to share a bundle of clothes lie in the corner of one of the bedrooms beside a discarded mattress			1
the property is thought to have been run by rogue landlords whose hands it fell into after being given to housing associations and cooperatives in the 1970s council chiefs slammed the landlord for maintaining the property to such low standards describing it as a ' risk to life and limb ' though very little detail about the landlord and tenants is known ( all had fled by the time authorities arrived at the property ) , experts estimate that each room may have been let out for around £ 100 a week - pulling £ 41,600 a year			1
it is one of 1,200 properties that were licensed to housing associations and cooperatives in the 1970s on a short - term basis when the council did n't have the funds to refurbish them to a high - enough standard			1
forty years after falling into the hands of negligent owners , the flats and houses are being reclaimed by the government			0
last week electricians discovered another of the ' short - life ' properties had been rerouting its electricity to other people 's metres			1
experts said it was one of the most dangerous sites they had seen in 35 years and that it was a miracle no one in the property had been electrocuted			0
@entity167 is considering launching legal action against the landlord			0
the property on @entity9 's @entity171 ( pictured ) in south @entity10 is one of more than 1,200 which fell into the wrong hands decades ago			1
