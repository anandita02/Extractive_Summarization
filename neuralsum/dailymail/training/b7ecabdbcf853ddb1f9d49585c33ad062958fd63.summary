by dr @entity0 holidays are a much longed - for time to relax and you do n’t want them ruined by a health complaint			1
yet few of us have room to pack a first - aid kit			2
here , dr @entity0 , a @entity9 gp , offers his diy tips for dealing with everyday medical problems			1
honey or sugar for minor wounds for centuries honey has been used to treat skin wounds and burns small grazes or cuts can become infected , especially in hot climates where bacteria can flourish			1
for centuries honey has been used to treat skin wounds and burns and is now used in hospitals around the globe to deal with skin infections			1
honey helps kill the bacteria that may cause infection			1
when honey comes into contact with damaged skin , it triggers the production of antibacterial hydrogen peroxide			1
furthermore , the sugars in honey mean there is little space for water molecules ( bacteria need water to survive , so reducing the amount available makes it hard for them to thrive )			1
dabbing on honey or a sprinkling of sugar can deprive the bacteria of water , which ultimately destroys them			1
after washing hands thoroughly , clean the wound , dab a little honey on it and cover with a clean dressing			1
any honey will do — you do n’t need to use the expensive kind			1
alternatively , sprinkle on sugar			1
to prevent spillage , smear a thin coating of petroleum jelly around the wound first			2
these ‘ sweet ’ treatments can be reapplied a couple of times a day			2
if the injured area becomes red , hot , painful , or discharges pus , or if fever occurs , seek medical advice straight away as this may indicate an infection			2
@entity70 for insect bites a bite from a gnat , midge , mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle — this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy - like reaction			2
as a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin , which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch			2
while bites themselves are rarely a problem , this itch can be , as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that , in turn , leads to potential problems such as scarring			0
there are endless possible treatments , but two of my favourites are teabags and oatmeal			0
steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes , allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth			0
this helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent , so reduce the swelling			0
alternatively , mix uncooked oatmeal and water into a paste and apply to the itchy area directly , or put the paste into a muslin cloth and hold to the skin			0
oatmeal can help reduce inflammation and has a calming , cooling effect on the bite			0
steep a few teabags , left , in boiling water for ten minutes , allow to cool and apply liquid to the insect bite using a cloth			0
it will help to relive inflammation of the sting @entity137 variously called sodium bicarbonate , baking soda , or simply ‘ bicarb ’ , it ’s good to have a small tub of this in your travel bag			1
on holiday , exposure to chemicals such as the chlorine in the swimming pool can irritate the area where urine leaves the body ( the urethra ) and can trigger cystitis in women			0
essentially , this is inflammation of the bladder and can lead to a burning sensation when you pass urine			0
there are other factors that can make it a common holiday ailment : heat and alcohol can dehydrate the body , making the bladder more prone to inflammation ; ‘ holding on ’ when it ’s inconvenient to go to the toilet , or facilities are unavailable , can also contribute			0
@entity172 is alkaline , so drinking half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda stirred into a glass of water several times a day helps as it makes urine less acidic and less likely to cause stinging			0
it wo n’t reduce the inflammation in the bladder but it will reduce the pain while the inflammation goes down			0
if symptoms do n’t improve after a couple of days , or if you have a fever , blood in the urine or loin pain , seek medical advice straight away			0
@entity192 sunburn can occur in as little as 20 minutes			1
but you may not even know you have been burnt until five hours later when the damage done will come out as red inflamed patches of skin			0
@entity197 , a well - known soothing remedy for tired and sore eyes , can also help bring relief to sore , sunburned skin			0
this is because it contains vitamin c and caffeic acid ( an antioxidant also found in coffee ) which both have anti-inflammatory effects that help reduce the irritation of sunburn			1
@entity197 , a well - known soothing remedy for tired and sore eyes , can also help bring relief to sore , sunburned skin because it contains vitamin c and caffeic acid ( an antioxidant also found in coffee ) which both have anti-inflammatory effects while many foods contains vitamin c , it ’s the combination of these compounds that works best — together with the cooling effects of the cucumber , especially if it ’s been in the fridge			1
for small areas of skin , slices of cool cucumber can be put straight on			1
if larger areas are affected , it may be more practical to grind cucumber into a paste using a blender or fork , then apply			1
to make it less messy , you can hold it in place with a sterile dressing and keep it there for as long as is needed			0
bananas for hangover drinking wo n’t just dehydrate you ( because alcohol is a diuretic ) , many people also feel light - headed and woozy the morning after			1
this is because normally the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream			0
but when the liver is busy processing alcohol , this does n’t happen , which can lead to low blood sugar levels			1
while drinking plenty of water can rehydrate you , a banana helps raise depleted sugar levels — the reason being that it has a low glycaemic index			1
this means the sugar it contains is released slowly			1
while a biscuit , for example , would raise blood sugar , it would do it quickly , so the body would release a flood of insulin to quickly reduce blood sugar levels			1
this sudden fall in blood sugar would leave you feeling just as bad as you had before			2
the banana would give a more sustained recovery			0
a banana is also gentle on the stomach , which may be irritated by the alcohol			0
@entity280 for sore eyes tea , especially camomile , is a particularly good choice for swollen and irritated eyes , whether caused by lack of sleep , allergies or simply sand			0
@entity290 contains anti-irritant compounds such as terpenoids , and flavonoids , a form of antioxidant that soothes inflammation			2
brew a cup of camomile tea			0
remove the teabag and allow it to cool then place against closed eyes			0
@entity303 travel sickness is caused by conflicting information received by the brain from the ears about balance and from the eyes about what you see			1
this jumble of information triggers feelings of nausea and tummy upset when travelling in cars , boats and planes			0
@entity319 is used to relieve morning sickness in pregnancy and to help overcome the nausea associated with chemotherapy			2
some scientific studies suggest that it can also help with motion sickness			2
it ’s believed that compounds called gingerols and shogaols — which give ginger its spiciness — are what provide the benefits , possibly by blocking chemical messages in the brain , so helping to relax muscles in the stomach and gut			2
how you take it is up to you , but popular ways include ginger tea , ginger biscuits and dried ginger note : the content of this feature is for information purposes only and not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice , diagnosis or treatment			2
always seek the advice of your doctor or other qualified health professional with any questions			0
