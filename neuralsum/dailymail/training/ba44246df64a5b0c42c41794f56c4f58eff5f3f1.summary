by @entity0 @entity2 's famous exports include beer and chocolate but did you also know they gave the world the @entity7 ? with the recent release of two @entity11 movies attracting a new generation of fans to the franchise , the @entity2 tourist board are hoping they can capitalise on the love of the dwarves to bring new visitors to their country			1
the lovable blue characters were the invention of @entity2 cartoonist @entity21 , aka @entity21 , who first drew them for a cartoon strip in 1958			1
proud : the @entity2 pay homage to the @entity7 with this statue and the @entity26 in @entity27 global stars : but the little blue dwarves were first famous in @entity2 the late cartoonist ' @entity21 ' with the characters he created : memorabilia similar to that he 's surrounded by can be bought in @entity27 's @entity35 his comic strips and albums quickly became a hit in his native country and have since been translated into more than 30 different languages			1
when @entity42 turned the comics into a tv cartoon series in the @entity45 the @entity7 found even more global fame - so much so that many people are unaware of their @entity49 origins			0
@entity50 , a tour guide at the @entity52 in @entity27 - that has a whole section dedicated to the @entity7 - told @entity54 : ' @entity7 have become so famous internationally that many people do n't know where they are from			1
but they are definitely @entity2 ! ' the proud @entity2 have never forgotten that the @entity7 are their own and the characters are celebrated in a number of venues across their capital of @entity27			1
still going strong : the @entity7 began as a cartoon strip in 1958 , left			2
now a new generation are fans thanks to the films using voices including @entity66 's as @entity67 in time for release of @entity7 2 on dvd and blu - ray this month , from 20 december to 9 february the city will host the @entity72 for the first time , in the sumptuous setting of the @entity75			1
four hundred and twenty tonnes of natural ice will be transformed to recreate the world of the @entity7 and other children 's favourites			1
and while the @entity7 are only meant to be ' three apples high ' , the ice sculptures will be up to six metres tall			2
away from the ice sculptures , @entity82 discovered there are other places where children ( and big kids ! ) can immerse themselves in the world of the @entity7 while in @entity27			1
as well as the aforementioned @entity89 , there 's the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) and the world 's only @entity11 store where fans can buy everything from @entity11 - related books and figurines to t - shirts and mugs			1
at the @entity99 , there 's a display showing how the @entity7 went from a humble cartoon strip to @entity102 with today 's big budget 3d films using the voice talents of stars including @entity66			1
sea of blue : the @entity108 has a display of @entity7 from giant statues to a model village museum exhibits : the figurines have become collectors ' items and many are on show in the country 's capital children can also marvel at the @entity11 model village there and meet giant versions of their heroes			1
both @entity26 and the @entity89 detail how the @entity7 came to be with @entity21 conceiving 99 @entity11 characters - all male - with different personality traits and then adding a token female , @entity67			1
feminists have slated the creator in the past for his lack of female characters and the @entity26 reveals that the decision did n't go down well with his wife either			0
it reveals : ' the way @entity21 introduced the @entity7 caused a lot of resentment between him and his wife			1
the @entity67 was created by @entity141 , the villain , as a blend of the following 10 ingredients : ' a spark of coquetry , a large dose of prejudice , three tears of a crocodile , the brains of a shrimp , the tongue of a vampire , a little bit of wickedness , a handful of anger , a little bit of lies , deep fondness for sweets , a little bit of bad faith , a little bit of unpredictability , a streak of pride , a cup of envy , some sensitivity , a part of foolishness , a part of cunning , a handful of moodiness , two cups of stubbornness and an excess of waste			0
' @entity180 , author of the book @entity182 of @entity7 : a celebration of @entity184 , said the sexism is down to the @entity7 being a product of their time			0
he told the @entity189 : ' let 's face it , it 's in the @entity191			0
anyone who has seen an episode of @entity194 , or actually lived through the early - to - mid - ' 60s , knows that it was n't exactly the best time to be a woman			0
and we 're also talking about @entity2 , and the whole @entity199 culture of celebrating your love through misery			2
' there have been small attempts to redress the balance with @entity42 adding some extra female smurfs while the most recent film , @entity7 2 , has a new female character voiced by @entity209			1
@entity11 world : the store has everything from figurines to towels , books and rucksacks there 's only one @entity67 : the other original 99 characters are male both the @entity26 , the @entity89 and the smurf store show how the characters have become a global phenomenon and their popularity has endured despite their apparent sexism and lack of modernism			1
they have even been able to transcend the death of @entity21 in 1992 with the latest films creating original storylines for a new audience			2
but mr @entity50 explains that comics like the @entity7 are n't just a means of entertaining children in @entity2			1
they also serve to educate by teaching them about historical and topical events			0
for example in the @entity7 , the story @entity11 - where one of the @entity7 proclaims themselves king - aims to teach children about democracy and the dangers of dictatorships			1
meanwhile the story @entity243 was based on @entity2 politics and the turmoil caused by their @entity247 and @entity248 divide			0
@entity249 also aims to celebrate cartoon strips as the ' 9th art form ' and encourage children to be creative and draw their own characters as well as reading about them			0
@entity249 , pictured , is popular with children ( and grown up @entity11 fans ) : it 's a place where they 're encouraged to read and be creative @entity259 children visiting the museums can learn more than just about cartoons thanks to the @entity7 first being written in @entity247 and @entity262			1
the cartoon displays give them the opportunity to learn the languages in a visual and easy to understand way			0
and it 's not just the @entity7 who cartoon fans can see when visiting the region			2
@entity2 also gave the world another comic hero whose adventures have stood the test of time - @entity275			2
there are displays dedicated to him at the @entity26 and @entity280 museums as well as other characters created by @entity2 artists such as @entity283 and @entity284 and @entity285			1
they will all be included in the @entity288 display			0
families keen to see the ice sculptures before they melt away in february can take advantage of the fact @entity293 operates from @entity294 to @entity27 with the direct journey taking just two hours			2
return fares cost from £ 69 if booked in advance			0
art nouveau masterpiece : the @entity299 is homed in an impressive building designed by @entity301 in 1905 a visit to learn about the @entity7 in the festive season also provides an opportunity to visit the city 's @entity306 market including a fun fair and see the famous nativity scene in the @entity310 that includes live animals			1
the museums mentioned above are year round attractions and children can also do a comic book trail of the city , a kind of treasure hunt to find giant murals of cartoon characters that have been drawn on buildings around @entity27			2
they can even have lunch surrounded by their favourite characters at the @entity324 in @entity325 which includes memorabilia from the @entity7 , as well as @entity327 and other global animators			0
accompanying adults are likely to be fans of the @entity7 themselves having also grown up with the cartoons			0
but if not , the architecture of the @entity89 is likely to wow them if the content does n't			0
it was designed by @entity2 's most famous architect , @entity301 in 1905 as a textile factory in an art nouveau style			2
the building was nearly destroyed - like some of @entity301 's other work - when art nouveau went out of fashion in the mid 20th century but was saved thanks to it becoming the home of the comics			0
the use of glass in the ceiling and floor tiles coupled with the mosaic floor makes it a light and airy space to display exhibits			0
and if the @entity11 sightseeing all gets too much , parents can unwind after the exhibition visits with another @entity2 speciality - beer			2
