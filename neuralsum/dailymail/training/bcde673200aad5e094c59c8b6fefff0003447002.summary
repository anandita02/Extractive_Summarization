by @entity0 last updated at 10:57 pm on 18th january 2012 @entity2 bankers at @entity3 are in line for a pay and bonus pot of £ 1.5billion , despite a fall in profits			1
with @entity10 in the grip of a recession , the announcement will only add to public fury over @entity15 payouts			0
the company , which is awarding its workers £ 8.2billion globally , has 5,300 staff based in @entity10			1
business secretary @entity19 said : ' these pay awards reflect a basic lack of reality about the world we now live in			1
the company , which is awarding its workers £ 8.2billion globally , has 5,300 staff based in @entity10 ' the concern is that it could have a knock - on effect throughout the banking sector at exactly the time the @entity29 and businesses are urging restraint			1
' @entity3 is paying out an average of £ 238,000 in salary , bonuses and equity awards to its approximate 30,000 staff globally for their efforts in 2011			1
this is down from an average £ 280,000 the previous year			1
@entity39 , @entity3 's finance director , insisted that ' discretionary ' bonuses were down ' considerably more than revenues ' during the year			1
the news comes despite disappointing annual results from the investment bank			0
@entity3 ( nicknamed the ' @entity46 ' as its tentacles stretch far and wide ) revealed profits fell to £ 1.95billion last year , from £ 5.5billion in 2010			1
this would make it its second lowest annual profit in almost ten years , reflecting the impact @entity54 's debt crisis is having on the @entity56 bank			1
the total pot this year is £ 1.8billion less than the £ 10billion awarded for their efforts the previous year			1
occupy @entity2 protesters outside @entity61 's making a stand against corporate greed the dip in profits also underlines the struggle the bank , under chief executive @entity68 , is facing from new regulations			2
the @entity70 , due to come into force in july , bans banks from gambling with their own money and limits the amount of capital they can invest in hedge funds and private equity investments			0
former banker @entity78 said : ' i think a firm like @entity3 has real problems			1
' some of the lines they 've been traditionally strong in are being regulated out of existence , ' he told @entity85			0
@entity3 is axing 1,000 jobs and cutting £ 780million in costs by the middle of the year to protect profits			1
however , it may take some solace in the fact it topped the mergers and acquisitions league table in the @entity10 , consulting on deals worth £ 76.5billion			2
a protester waves a sign outside @entity3 's @entity99 hq preparing for ' doughnut ' bonuses the bars around @entity2 's finance district may soon start filling up with bankers fresh from pay discussions , but not many will be there to splash their bonus cash			1
this year zero bonuses , known as ' doughnuts ' , will affect even senior staff and could include a bigger proportion of employees than in the 2008 financial crisis , bankers and headhunters predicted as @entity117 firms start telling bankers this week what they will get			1
slumping quarterly profits , a darkening long - term outlook for the industry and unrelenting pressure from politicians and an angry public , are pushing bank bosses to break away from a culture in which most staff expect a bonus every year and base their personal budget around it			2
' this will probably be the worst year for zero bonuses we 've seen , although those that will have done well will still get something , ' said @entity138 , who runs recruiting firm @entity139			2
' global heads and senior managing directors are among those that will get nothing -- they 're the expensive staff , and they 'll be living off their higher salaries			2
' underperforming bankers already came under pressure in the 2010 bonus round as ' doughnuts ' multiplied , but this time division heads are raising the bar and reserving payouts for an even smaller group of star bankers			0
bonuses would be down at least 30 per cent for those that do get one , @entity138 said , while other recruiters predict cuts of up to 70 per cent in some areas , such as bond trading			0
bankers at @entity3 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 are among those expecting to hear about their bonuses this week , coinciding with these firms ' fourth quarter results			1
overall pay at @entity165 's investment bank came in at $ 8.8billion , down 9 per cent on 2010 levels , while total revenues for the year were flat , its filings showed last week			1
bonuses at @entity177 could total as much as £ 500million the rise of ' doughnuts ' will not mean the end to bonuses or to public anger over payouts			2
at government - controlled banks like @entity10 's @entity177 , where bonuses are likely to total £ 400 - 500million , according to sources and company reports , these rewards are still under fire			1
' it 's extremely difficult to justify any bonus at all at a state - owned bailed - out bank , ' @entity191 mp @entity190 said			0
@entity190 joined about 40 anti-capitalist protesters from the ' @entity197 ' movement in a gathering outside the offices of @entity10 's financial watchdog last week , condemning excessive executive pay			2
ahead of this year 's bonus season , the @entity10 government has also moved to clamp down on rewards by suggesting shareholders should get a veto on pay			1
as scrutiny of investment banks ' pay practices mounts , many are already taking their own steps to amend the structure of rewards , beyond just cutting them			0
@entity164 will reportedly tell employees this week that cash payouts will be capped at £ 80,000 ( $ 125,000 ) , with any portion received above this deferred until at least the end of the year			2
top management might defer their entire bonuses for 2012			0
@entity221 , the boss of taxpayer - backed @entity222 , revealed last week that he would not take his annual bonus for last year ' whiter than white ' senior bankers since 2009 , salaries have often doubled for top investment bankers , to around £ 350,000 ( $ 536,500 ) on average , according to recruiters ' estimates			1
this was after firms tried to find ways around a bonus tax in @entity10 and tougher rules on rewards across @entity54			0
it put additional pressure on bonus pots , through which firms still have some leverage to cut pay costs			0
senior bankers in charge of bonus decisions for their teams have been talking tough about pay for months , preparing staff for lower payouts by pointing to the thousands of jobs being cut across the industry and to the rise in salaries			0
' we 've got to be realistic			0
we 're not talking hardship here , ' said a division head at one major @entity117 firm			0
' there is a psychological impact when you do n't get a bonus - it used to mean you 're not doing well and could be let go			0
' it does n't make the [ bonus ] conversation very easy , but this year there will be strength in numbers			0
' many expect these senior bankers to be among those to forgo big payouts , partly as a move to appease disgruntled staff			0
' they have to be seen to be whiter than white , and not to be necessarily paying themselves but the performers in their teams , ' said @entity277 , chairman of headhunters @entity279			0
last week , the boss of @entity222 forfeited a £ 2.4million bonus for 2011 , saying he wants to share the pain being suffered by ordinary people			0
@entity221 , who returned to work this month after treatment at the @entity286 clinic for exhaustion , said his bonus should reflect ‘ the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing ’			0
but the 47 - year - old @entity292 executive could still earn up to £ 10million for 2011 , thanks to a ‘ golden handshake ’ awarded to compensate him for benefits lost when he left @entity298 to join @entity222 .			2
