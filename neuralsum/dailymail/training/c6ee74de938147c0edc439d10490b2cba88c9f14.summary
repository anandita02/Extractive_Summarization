by @entity0 for @entity1 rural drivers concerned they will be banned from using bull bars on their cars have formed a lobby group to raise awareness of how vital they are in the bush			1
the @entity9 of @entity10 has opened up a @entity12 page plastered with cars destroyed by accidents they say would have been avoided if the car was equipped with a bull bar , including a ' famous ' picture of a dead kangaroo on the back seat of a car after flying through a windscreen			1
police have recently launched a crackdown across @entity25 on bull bars , issuing defect notices to drivers , particularly ones with five - post bull bars , which have been illegal since 2003			1
the concerns from bull bar owners have gone underway after a man was believed to be killed when a kangaroo went crashing through his windscreen in @entity35 but @entity36 , who started the @entity12 group in july told @entity1 that there were no clear reasons as to why police are issuing defect notices or warnings to people			2
' we ’re not entirely sure why police are cracking down on bull bars – roads and @entity49 and police have not made any comments , ' he said			2
' they tell the media that they 're enforcing rules that have been place in 2003 but there 's no actual rules that states in the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) that " five post bars are illegal			0
' mr @entity36 , 25 , from @entity60 said the kangaroo incident from october 2006 , saw a 50 - year - old man die after a car moving in the opposite direction hit the kangaroo , pushing it through the windscreen of the victim 's car near @entity70 , 300km south of @entity35			0
' the photograph of the dead kangaroo in the backseat pretty much sums up the whole point on why it 's so important to have these necessities in rural areas , ' he said			0
facebook users have taken to the @entity9 of @entity10 page to form a united front on the issue and raise awareness that lives will be put at risk if they get banned another similar incident occurred west of @entity85 in october last year when a six - year - old girl sitting in the back seat of her family car died from a kangaroo smashing through the front windscreen before it exit through the rear window			1
mr @entity36 said that not only do bull bars save lives , they also prevent major impacts to the engines of vehicles involved			2
' if someone was driving in the middle of nowhere and was struck by a kangaroo with no bull bar protection - they would be stranded with no food or water , and even phone reception - so we need to make sure bull bars stay legal , ' he said			2
a family car was written off after hitting a kangaroo out of @entity110 @entity10			0
the driver said the damage would have been minimal if he had a bullbar ' rural vehicles operate on rural roads and small towns so there 's not a lot of people around and they 're not distracted by their mobile phones , ' mr @entity36 said			0
' children are taught to cross roads safely at a young age but i 'm still yet to hear someone teaching a kangaroo , feral pig or wombat how to cross the road			0
' i am aware that children do the unexpected sometimes and run out on the road to chase a ball but the potential risk of an animal strike on a rural vehicle without a bull bar are greater than the likely hood of hitting a pedestrian			0
this is not a five post bullbar but it was enough to save the lives of this driver and his dad after they hit a cow at 105kmh @entity148 mp @entity147 raised the issue in @entity150 , saying he had been inundated with phone calls , emails and letters from people who had been issued with defect notices or warnings from police for having bull bars on their vehicles which do n’t comply with @entity161 standards			1
' people are trying to do the right thing - they are trying to protect their vehicles and their loved ones yet they are being penalised , ' mr @entity147 said			1
' many drivers in my electorate have been caught and have been issued with defect notices by highway police patrol for bullbars that have been factory - fitted or fitted by accredited smash repairers and they have unwittingly been driving around - some of them for many years - with bullbars that do not comply with @entity161 standards			0
' this driver of this vehicle said if only he had his five poster bull bar - this would n't have happened ' they are incurring expenses of sometimes in excess of $ 4000 to replace those bull bars which are compliant with the rules , ' mr @entity147 said			1
' @entity185 are essential for many people living in rural areas , protecting vehicles and , more importantly , protecting people 's lives , especially on our roads with huge numbers of kangaroos and other animals around , ' he said			1
' it 's completely reasonable for people who buy a new vehicle from a dealership fitted with a bullbar or have one fitted by accredited businesses assume that it meets with @entity161 standards			0
after all , why would a car dealer or a smash repairer fit a bullbar that is illegal ? why would bullbars that do n't comply be allowed to be manufactured and distributed ? ' this driver said her bull bar saved her life after colliding with an embarkment while falling asleep at the wheel			0
' i believe bullbars make a huge difference when it comes to living in the country ' mr @entity147 told the @entity150 that he had personally taken the issue up with minister for roads and freight @entity219 and minister for fair trading @entity221			1
' both ministers were very concerned about the situation and i ’m grateful for the action that ’s been taken already , ' he said			0
' the @entity226 for @entity227 is liaising with @entity228 to raise awareness , as i have with local police , that people are being inadvertently caught in this blitz on illegal bull bars			1
the @entity226 is also urging that common sense prevail and those who are unwittingly caught should not be unduly penalised			0
' additionally , the @entity226 , @entity236 , police and @entity238 are now all working together to gather evidence about manufacturers which are producing and selling these non-compliant bull bars			2
' in the meantime , i ’m going to keep pushing the case for a change of approach over bull bars to ensure people in rural areas are not unduly penalised for staying safe on the road .			1

rural drivers fear that the necessity to fend off animals will be **outlawed** if @entity228 continue to crackdown on bull bars
police have been targeting the illegal five - post design bars in rural areas , which have been illegal since 2003
the @entity12 page hopes to raise awareness that lives will be put at risk if bull bars get **outlawed**
@entity148 mp @entity147 has raised the issue in @entity150
mr @entity147 said he will continue to push the case to ' ensure people in rural areas are not unduly penalised for staying safe on the road '
