by @entity0 @entity1 will launch a series of female scientists and their lab tools after a pioneering proposal was selected as the latest @entity7 winner			1
@entity11 - based geochemist and avid @entity1 builder dr @entity8 submitted her idea to the toy giant , who will start selling the products in august			1
the new series will include a female astronomer with a telescope , female paleontologist with a dinosaur skeleton , and female chemist in a lab. the figurines will be entirely devoid of the colour pink			1
the image shown is a generic minifigure image from an old series of @entity1			1
the toy firm will launch a series of female scientists and their lab tools in august in her project proposal , @entity8 wrote : ' the motto of these scientists is clear : explore the world and beyond ! ' report the @entity35			1
on her blog she wrote of her recognition of a clear gender gap among @entity1 figurines			1
' as a female scientist i had noticed two things about the available @entity1 sets : a skewed male / female minifigure ratio and a rather stereotypical representation of the available female figures , ' she wrote			1
' it seemed logical that i would suggest a small set of female minifigures in interesting professions to make our @entity51 communities more diverse			2
' ' any toy or any activity that dispels the idea that a girl 's value lies just in the way she looks is a positive idea ' the toy company has been criticised in the past for its gender - based marketing tactics , but these latest additions could mark a change in direction for them			1
leading psychologist dr @entity66 , 43 , who has an 11 - year - old daughter , spoke with @entity68 about her personal and professional stance on the launch of the new product			1
' my daughter 's a big fan of @entity1 , and i 've been thinking about this a lot , ' she said			1
' i buy her the architectural designs you can get an the @entity78 building [ such as the @entity79 ]			0
they are the least gender specific @entity1 toys - just buildings ' i remember thinking , " what a lovely idea "			1
you can read a bit about who the architects are			0
it 's not all this " would you like the pink section or the blue section "			2
' i think any toy or any activity that dispels the idea that a girl 's value lies just in the way she looks ; that shows she can be more than that , that she can do more , is a positive idea			2
' sadly female scientists or business leaders are n't celebrated in the same way that males are , so this is fantastic			2
' the younger you can get girls to see these things as the norm the better			0
getting them to see that it 's just as normal for a woman to wear a white doctor 's or scientist 's coat as it is for a man ; that 's such an important thing			2
' the whole idea that there is the whole idea that there is just one section for girls - the pink section - reinforces gender stereotypes			2
' of course , there 's always going to be evolutionary differences , but so many more toys aimed at girls have to do with being pretty and looking a certain way , whereas those all about having fun and action heroes are for boys			2
' girls need to be seen as doers rather than passive , to subvert the objectification of women			0
the object is someone acted upon ; " how can i make my hair curlier , my lips pinker , my eyes brighter "			0
' i think there 's a problem here			0
' the prototype image submitted by dr @entity8 , who designed the new toy set @entity146 , spokesperson for @entity7 commented : ' we ’re very excited to release @entity7 enthusiast , @entity8 ’s @entity145 set as our next @entity7 fan based set			1
' after receiving over 10,000 votes from the online community and having gone through rigorous toy testing from our expert panel , this awesome set is on track to be released on shelves this august			0
