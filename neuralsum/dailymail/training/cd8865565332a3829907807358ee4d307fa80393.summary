by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 old ties : @entity2 speaking as the @entity3 at the @entity5 conference in 2008 former cabinet minister @entity2 is at the centre of claims that he ‘ covered up ’ his membership of a @entity5 social club in an attempt to defuse the controversy over his new high - powered job at the @entity13			2
his appointment as the @entity13 ’s £ 295,000 - a - year director of strategy and digital has angered senior conservatives because he was a @entity5 mp between 2001 and 2010 and served as @entity19 under @entity20			1
mr @entity2 ’s boss , @entity13 director - general lord hall , insists that mr @entity2 is now impartial , having ‘ hung his boots up at the door and left politics behind ’			2
but doubt has been cast on this claim after it emerged he is still listed in the 2013 edition of @entity30 as a member of @entity32 near @entity33			1
the @entity13 insisted the entry was a mistake – only to be contradicted by the club			0
the saga then took a farcical turn when a club stewardess mistook a @entity41 reporter for mr @entity2 and told him : ‘ sorry , @entity42 , a reporter has been on and caught me unawares			2
’ the club is in mr @entity2 ’s former @entity32 constituency			1
disgraced @entity13 presenter @entity46 has also been a frequent visitor			0
when a reporter first rang the club , the stewardess said mr @entity2 ‘ definitely ’ belonged , adding : ‘ something happened the other week and his name came up			2
’ but when the @entity13 was asked if @entity2 was still a member , a spokesman insisted he left the club in 2010			2
a mail on sunday journalist then phoned the stewardess , saying he wanted to ‘ talk about @entity2 ’			0
@entity57 , the stewardess said : ‘ sorry , @entity42 , i ca n’t really hear what you are saying but it ’s about a journalist from the @entity55 who has been on			0
but when he called back again later , i said i could n’t divulge anything			0
’ a club regular later claimed @entity2 had been there as recently as last autumn			1
awkward questions : is @entity2 still a member of @entity32 in @entity68 , @entity33 ? and a source at @entity30 confirms that although @entity2 has updated some details since 2010 in his listing , he has never removed his membership of the club			1
@entity75 mp @entity74 said : ‘ it appears @entity2 has not been totally straight about this matter and has n’t hung up his political boots			0
’ a @entity13 spokesman last night insisted mr @entity2 left the club in 2010			0
the spokesman said the confusion had arisen from an outdated @entity30 entry – and falsely accused @entity41 of masquerading as @entity2 in a phone conversation			1
' no longer political ' : @entity2 with then prime minister @entity20 a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity32 has confirmed that @entity2 has not been a member since 2010			1
the only contact @entity2 has had with the club in the last three years was this week when a trustee alerted him to journalist enquiries and a phone call they had received from someone purporting to be @entity2 but who was not him			0
’ @entity2 said : ‘ i have not been a member of the @entity32 since 2010			1
my @entity30 entry is out of date and will be updated shortly			0

@entity2 served as @entity19 under @entity20
