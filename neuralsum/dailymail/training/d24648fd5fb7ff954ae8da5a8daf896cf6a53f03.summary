by @entity0 in these days of movie megastars and overly precious pop stars , we have all heard stories of celebrity guests who make outrageous demands of the hotels they frequent			2
but it seems that many members of the general public can be just as diva - like – and delusional – when it comes to what they expect of the places in which they stay			0
ring ring : according to the survey , strange requests made by hotel guests have included goat bells to aid sleep outrageous orders and crazy complaints regularly stretch the patience of even the best - trained staff , according to a research conducted by flight comparison website @entity29			1
the survey – which questioned 400 hotel staff in 49 countries – reveals a world of grasping guests and cantankerous customers for whom no tantrum is too ridiculous			1
@entity29 has compiled a list of the ten most unusual requests made by hotel guests – as well as the top ten most outlandish complaints			1
woof woof : one guest complained that his dog was unhappy with the level of service at the hotel , and did not enjoy its stay , while another difficult customer wanted mineral water - not for drinking , but for the toilet bowl the latter line - up includes far - from - happy customers appalled that their room did not come with a sea view , even though they were staying miles from the coast , a light sleeper angry that they had been kept awake by their own girlfriend ’s snoring – and a peeved diner unamused to find that a vegetarian menu in a hotel restaurant did not include steak			1
one glass of water on the hour every hour , through the night2			0
toilet to be filled with mineral water4			0
sound of goat bells to aid sleep6			0
only the right legs of a chicken to be served7			0
@entity71 full of chocolate milk9			2
16 pillows ( for a single guest ) 10			0
the sheets are too white2			0
the sea is too blue3			0
ice cream is too cold4			0
girlfriend ’s snoring has kept guest awake6			1
@entity90 ’s dog did not enjoy its stay7			1
hotel has no ocean view ( in @entity94 ) 8			2
there is no steak on the vegetarian menu9			0
mother of groom has not been given the honeymoon suite other fantastical flashpoints included a guest upset that the bath in their suite was too big , and an animal lover who wanted a discount because his dog had not enjoyed its stay			1
and some people , it seems , are never happy			0
one guest was moved to raise a concern about the waiter who served them at dinner – saying he was too handsome for their liking			2
the list of unlikely requests features a range of demands that would surely make the most riotous rock star or highly - strung actress blush			2
one guest wanted a glass of water to be delivered to their room – on the hour , every hour , throughout the night			2
another insisted that they could not drop off into the land of nod without the sounds of the mountains – and could a range of goat bells be provided ? no no : according to the research , a guest complained that the waiter serving them was too handsome - while another asked for chicken for their dinner , as long as they were served only right legs from available poultry another wanted a dinner of chicken			1
not too outrageous , you might think – except for the fact that , the guest stipulated , only legs from the right side of the chicken should be served as part of the meal			0
other food - themed blasts from the barely believable included a customer who wanted a bowl of crocodile soup , and a weight - watcher who asked for 15 cucumbers per day			1
incredible en - suite - related wishes included baths filled with honey or chocolate milk			1
and spare a thought for staff at the hotel where a guest demanded a further bathroom - linked change to the room : they wanted their toilet to be filled with mineral water .			1

survey of hotel staff in 49 countries reveals hotel guests ' bizarre behaviour
requests have included baths full of honey and crocodile soup for dinner
