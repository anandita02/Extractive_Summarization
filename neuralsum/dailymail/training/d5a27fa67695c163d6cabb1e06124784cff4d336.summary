by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 06:00 est , 30 july 2013 @entity3 mobiliser @entity1 pictured in the @entity4 within the @entity3 ' conservation is not just a man 's thing			0
women should have an equal role to play , ' says @entity1 , who works with the @entity11 government to encourage more women to get involved with tiger protection			2
i 'm speaking to the landscape community mobiliser for @entity16 during a trip to @entity18 where i witness the charity 's staff grapple with the biggest wildlife crisis the country has ever faced			1
@entity24 numbers have dropped by 97 per cent in the last 100 years and the species faces total extinction within a generation if things do not improve			1
@entity1 's mission to protect tigers in the @entity3 region is in its 12th year			0
through her work with the @entity34 coordination committee , where she leads anti-poaching , reforestation and education projects , @entity1 is not only helping to protect @entity18 's tigers but also giving the country 's women real work and a purpose			1
but despite her years on the job , @entity1 has seen a tiger only twice			1
' when i saw a tiger for the first time , it did n't strike my mind			2
i did not know how to react			0
' it was only later , when i spoke with the two people i was with that they told me the creature was a tiger			2
' it crossed my path			0
it was pretty big , and if i had known it was a tiger i might have been scared			2
' before i had seen a tiger there was this talk in the village , a common thought that only a few lucky people actually get to see one in real life			0
' when i realised i has seen one , i felt like one of the chosen few			0
that in itself is motivation for me			0
' tigers really are very rare now			0
on my visit to @entity18 , when they used to roam in abundance , i did n't see one in the flesh , despite all our efforts , although the film crew managed to find one drinking from a lake the day after we left			1
the sheer scale of tiger slaughter is reflected in the fact that just a century ago , 100,000 tigers roamed the wild lands of @entity18			1
on a visit in 1911 , the famously trigger - happy @entity85 was able to leave with a staggering 39 trophies after a hunting trip			0
a century later , that equates to a third of the country 's entire tiger population			0
@entity16 anti-poaching patrols look out for tiger traps			1
when they find them , they dismantle them and dispose of them			0
@entity1 herself has been involved in the capture of six tiger poachers between 2004 and 2005 , although she goes on patrol less today than she used to			0
she lives and works in the @entity128 in the @entity4 which bridges @entity18 's @entity106 with @entity130 's @entity129			1
this is a crucial focus area for @entity16 but it is also an optimum spot for poacher activity as they make their way through @entity18 from the country of supply to the one of demand			1
@entity16 staff patrol the @entity141 on elephant , foot , bicycle , car , boat and uav piloting			1
as well as supplying patrol volunteers , they monitor tiger activity with motion - activated camera traps set up on trees			1
the photos are used to help confirm population numbers , as well as contribute to research on tiger behaviour and ecology that forms the basis for planning for their conservation			2
poaching is decreasing and @entity16 are confident that with support from communities , government , organisations and the public they can double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022			1
in the @entity171 forest in the @entity3 with an anti-poaching patrol group of young @entity11 women but the challenge the @entity16 and the @entity11 volunteers face is vast			2
while protecting the tigers , they 're also faced with tackling an ingrained belief in tiger parts as medicine held by many @entity183 and other @entity182 people			1
in the markets of @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , every part of the 40 stone body , from skin to bones , flesh and organs are sold for thousands of dollars			0
. ' the @entity183 still harbour bogus beliefs about medicinal properties of a tiger 's body parts , ' reveals @entity198 , @entity16 's @entity18 programme coordinator for wildlife trade monitoring			1
a continued belief in the medicinal properties of animal parts is the driving force behind 95 per cent of illegal trade in wildlife , including tigers , elephants , rhinos and red pandas			0
@entity24 bones are used for medicine , tiger balm and soup , while an underground tiger vineyard which produces wine infused with ground tiger bone produces thousands of bottles every year for sale on the @entity183 black market			1
@entity220 , a partner organisation of @entity16 , works in the @entity222 area to promote biodiversity and conservation			1
there is currently one tiger to 63 @entity228 deer - a potential meal for one of big endangered cats			2
but it takes a tiger , on average , 22 attempts to catch and kill a deer , so more needs to be done to reforest the area and up the ratio			2
the skin is still seen as a symbol of wealth while tiger flesh and organs are believed to cure ailments such as impotency			1
a bowl of soup made from tiger penis fetches an eye - watering 3,000 @entity185 dollars ( approx. £ 250 ) by promising to cure erectile dysfunction - and @entity198 tells me the demand for this potion in particular is increasing			1
despite the demand , the number of agencies , charities and governments ranged against the traffickers is increasing			0
the governments , @entity183 as well as @entity130 and @entity11 , all work together to curb illegal wildlife trade			1
the @entity183 government , @entity198 tells me , is cooperating well			2
but it 's not just poachers killing tigers - it 's local people who come into conflict with them			0
human - tiger conflict is a very real and present danger for the species			2
when tigers do not have enough prey , they seek out domestic livestock			0
many local communities depend on these animals for their livelihood and in retaliation , tigers are often killed or captured and sent to a zoo , in an effort to prevent similar events happening in the future			0
a local volunteer in the @entity4 , part of the community - based anti-poaching unit ( @entity288 ) , within the @entity3 region , walks away with a tiger trap found on patrol camera traps are being set up all over @entity106 to track and keep record of tiger count and mobility already struggling to tackle poaching , the @entity16 has had to divert precious resources to increasing prey numbers in an effort to reduce human - tiger conflict			1
worse , many of the tigers killed by locals end up on the black market and in @entity183 medicine - worsening the already devastating effect of poaching			1
local communities living around tiger habitats also depend on forests for wood			0
but by entering forests , they increase the likelihood of becoming victim to a tiger attack - which have increased in recent years			1
a recent study by @entity317 on attitudes towards tigers around @entity320 found natives are more likely to feel positive about them if they live on the ' good ' side of town , whereas those who live in rural and isolated areas have more negative attitudes			0
' when you feel that you can control your surroundings and influence the world around you , then you tend to be more positive about what 's in the forest , ' said @entity331 of the @entity332 who produced the report			0
@entity335 , field project officer with @entity18 reveals a tiger caught on the camera trap we set up the @entity16 works on projects to help people stay away from the forest and avoid tiger conflict			1
these include providing local communities with tolls such as stoves and systems with which they can use domestic animal waste as fuel instead of wood			0
there are also educational programmes in place to teach them about the value of tigers for tourism and the ecosystem			0
of the work done with local people , particularly important are the education programmes that teach that tigers are prolific predators who top of the food chain along with man			0
tigers attack and kill between eight and 10 people each year in @entity18 , and natives are understandably hostile			2
in @entity320 in 2005 , a single tiger killed a group of five people enjoying a picnic			0
this is especially common if the tiger is a mother with cubs			0
if the mother feels threatened or the cubs are hungry , the human has a problem			0
it is widely thought that when a tiger kills a person they get a taste for human blood - and so the people will hunt down the killer tiger to protect themselves			2
@entity16 have programmes in place to help people stay away from the forest and avoid tiger conflict			1
they provide stoves and a system with which they can use domestic animal waste as fuel instead of wood @entity24 numbers are at a critical low and they need all the protection they can get it is control and understanding of environment that @entity16 is trying to give back to the people so they can avoid conflict , and also teaching them to love and protect tigers			1
creating harmony within human - wildlife relationships is key to sustainably conserving species such as the tiger			2
but it means that yet more resources that could be used to take on the poachers has to be diverted into other projects			0
by purchasing special packs of @entity417 you can help save a tiger as a result , cat food brand @entity417 has partnered with the @entity16 and hopes to give a financial boost to those trying to protect tigers			1
they want consumers to understand the link between their own cats and endangered tigers in the wild so that collectively they can work together to help preserve this endangered species			0
little cat lovers can get involved by helping to raise funds for the protection of the world 's big cats through the purchase of special packs of @entity417			2
' these funds will go towards supporting the tiger conservation programme within the @entity3 region of @entity18 where currently only 120 tigers survive within their natural habitat , ' says @entity440 , a spokesperson for @entity417			1
visit the website to see how every special pack of @entity417 bought between now and august will help to protect a tiger for a day .			1

total tiger count worldwide is 3,200 , only 120 of the animals roam in @entity18
numbers reduced by 97 *%* in the last 100 years - they are close to extinction
demand for body parts for use in @entity183 medicine in behind problem
tiger penis soup - said to ' cure impotency ' - sells for *hk* *$* 3,000
