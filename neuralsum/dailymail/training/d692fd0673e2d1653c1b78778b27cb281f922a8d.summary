@entity1 design guru @entity0 has criticised the ' restrictive ' nature of the @entity4 regulations which have played their part in his decision to take a back - seat role this season			1
@entity1 's chief technical officer will shift his focus away from grand prix racing to helping sir @entity12 design a yacht to challenge for the @entity14			1
whilst still involved with @entity1 , @entity0 will be less hands on than in the past , primarily as he feels @entity4 has become an engine formula at present , offering him little scope to make a difference			1
@entity0 will shift his focus away from grand prix racing this season to concentrate on a sailing project ' you can always improve , but the problem is the limitation of the regulations , so much so the car is designed for you , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity4 should be a blend of the driver , chassis and engine , but the current regulations have swung too much in favour of the engine , combined with a very restrictive set of regulations on the chassis			1
' as the engine manufacturer has the benefit , it 's difficult for the chassis manufacturer to make enough of a difference to overturn that			0
' in @entity1 's case they saw their four successive years of title - winning success ended in crushing fashion by @entity48 last season			2
former @entity1 driver @entity50 in action at the first pre-season test in @entity53 earlier this year @entity48 won 16 of the 19 grands prix , with @entity1 claiming the other three via @entity55 , which was a triumph in itself given power - unit supplier @entity59 's woes in pre-season			2
@entity59 , though , have conceded they were 10 per cent down on power last term compared to @entity48 , highlighting just how far they were on the backfoot			0
concessions have been made for this season that will allow the power units to be developed via the use of a complicated token system			0
it at least allows @entity59 and @entity71 the opportunity to cut into @entity48 ' advantage , although @entity0 feels the latter will still be way out in front			0
' @entity59 have done a very good job of developing the engine over the winter , but you do n't overcome a 10 per cent deficit in a few months and that is the position we 're in , ' added @entity0			2
' we 're better than last year but still considerably down on where @entity48 were , which is not taking into account any findings they 've had over the winter			0
' @entity48 clearly are the favourites , they have a very good team and a great power unit			0

@entity0 says the sport 's new regulations have played a part in his decision to take a back - seat role this season
design guru @entity0 is shifting his focus away from grand prix racing
he will help sir @entity12 design a yacht to challenge for @entity14
@entity0 believes @entity4 has become primarily about the *strength* of the engine
