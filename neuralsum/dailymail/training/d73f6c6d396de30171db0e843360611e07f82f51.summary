two new earthquakes - the biggest so far - shook @entity3 's @entity2 volcano today as the country remained on alert for a major eruption			1
@entity3 's @entity7 said the quakes in the early hours had a magnitude of 5.3 and 5.1 , an escalation in strength after thousands of tremors shook the volcano over the last week			1
it prompted further fears that the volcano could erupt , spewing ash into the atmosphere in an echo of the cloud which caused chaotic flight delays throughout @entity22 in april 2010			1
uncertainty : the two largest earthquakes so far were recorded at the @entity2 volcano in @entity3 after a red alert was issued for flights			1
this afternoon the alert was downgraded to orange , but activity continued road closed : residents were advised to stay away from the volcano and a no - fly zone was introduced yesterday @entity3 's authorities issued a red alert for aviation - the highest on a five - point scale			1
a no - fly zone was declared as a precaution measuring 100 nautical miles by 140 nautical miles ( 185 kilometers by 260 kilometers ) around the epicentre of the quakes			2
this afternoon the risk was downgraded to orange after authorities said there were no signs of an imminent eruption			1
however , @entity3 's @entity48 said seismic activity continued underneath the huge glacier which has been the focus of the quakes			1
the volcano is in a mountain range on the southern part of the island underneath the vast @entity56 glacier			2
not a good time for a walk : @entity58 is flowing beneath the volcano and could come to the surface			2
@entity3 's authorities said this afternoon an eruption did not appear imminent but they were keeping a close watch restless sleep : the vast glacier today			1
some trans - @entity66 flights have been diverted as a precaution seismologists said yesterday that magma was moving under the glacier but so far had travelled horizontally at a depth of 3 to 6 miles			0
the volcano will erupt if the magma melts the ice above			0
on saturday scientists reported a small eruption under the ice , but it was not visible on the surface , and the @entity7 later said it appeared to have stopped			2
@entity81 's @entity80 said air travel would not be affected until an eruption actually breaks the ice			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity7 will be monitoring what 's occurring			0
they will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air			0
' if the eruption does occur we will issue what 's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions			0
it 's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly			0
' a 2010 eruption of @entity3 's @entity104 volcano caused a week of international aviation chaos , with more than 100,000 flights cancelled			1
dramatic landscape : @entity3 's snow - capped peaks conceal a high number of active volcanoes chaos : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled when the @entity104 volcano erupted in 2010 ( pictured ) aviation officials closed @entity22 's air space for five days out of fear that volcanic ash could harm jet engines			1
any new eruption is likely to be less disruptive because @entity22 aviation authorities have changed their policy in the wake of the chaos			2
airlines now receive detailed information about the location and density of ash clouds , although decisions on whether to fly are still left to them and national regulators			0
@entity81 's @entity130 said it was monitoring what it called a ' dynamic situation ' but was expecting normal operations today			0
however , alternative flight paths were being used across the @entity66 as a precaution			0
@entity136 also said a @entity138 - to - @entity139 flight took a slight detour yesterday to avoid @entity3 's no - fly zone .			0

quakes in early hours today had magnitude of 5.3 and 5.1 , largest so far
thousands of small tremors have hit @entity2 volcano this week
it prompted further fears of eruption and echo of 2010 ash cloud chaos
@entity155 downgraded this *lunchtime* to orange , but seismic activity continued
