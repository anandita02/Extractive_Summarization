@entity64 and @entity31 officials last week said that @entity24 was on the verge of taking @entity4 from its heavily outgunned @entity7 defenders after seizing strategic points deep inside the town			1
but as the tempo of coalition air strikes increased over the past few days , amid claims the warplanes were coordinating the raids with @entity7 fighters on the ground , @entity24 's advances dramatically slowed			1
the militants were eventually forced to flee from almost all of their locations in the south and west of the city , including the strategic @entity84 hill , as well as abandoning a number of key buildings and neighbourhoods in the east			2
despite their gains , @entity7 leaders say @entity4 can not survive long - term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders , something @entity64 - which lies just 200 yards to the city 's north - has so far refused to allow			1
the news comes as the new @entity99 human rights commissioner , @entity98 , described @entity24 as the antithesis of human rights and ' a diabolical , potentially genocidal movement '			2

he said : ' @entity342 is terribly busy insisting @entity31 ground troops wo n’t be going back into @entity143			2

the photojournalist has been a captive of @entity24 for two years he added : ' meanwhile , @entity31 puts 1,200 troops into @entity353 to protect their embassy and the airport			1

' in tonight ’s professionally - produced video , the 43 - year - old captive from @entity364 – wearing a @entity366 - style orange jumpsuit – said @entity342 's use of the plight of the @entity371 minority , which has suffered greatly at the hands of @entity24 , as justification of military force is disingenuous			0
