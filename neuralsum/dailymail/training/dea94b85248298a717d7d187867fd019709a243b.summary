thousands of older people are stuck in large family homes and unable to downsize because of a ‘ chronic shortage ’ of retirement housing , experts claim			2
the idea that they are adding to a housing shortage for younger generations by stubbornly refusing to move out is a myth , according to @entity10			2
the firm , which provides services for the over- 50s , said many retirees wanted to buy more practical accommodation but were prevented by a lack of choice			1
@entity10 , which provides services for the over- 50s , said many retirees wanted to buy more practical accommodation rather than stay in the family home but were prevented by a lack of choice the news comes as a report by @entity25 urged house builders to focus on providing attractive accommodation for pensioners to offset a potential care home crisis			1
the estate agent warned that the ageing population could be forced into care homes unnecessarily if more flexible retirement housing was not built			1
it said this should include ‘ aspirational ’ accommodation resembling ‘ five - star hotels ’ with spas , pools , gyms , manicured gardens and several restaurants			2
meanwhile , a @entity10 survey of 10,000 over- 50s found almost half would consider moving into more appropriate housing in retirement , rather than stay in their large family house			1
a fifth said they would move to provide money for a retirement free of financial worries , while one in 14 said they wanted to release money to help their families			0
@entity10 said more people would consider ‘ rightsizing ’ – moving into a home that suited their retirement needs better – if appropriate housing was available			1
the survey found that almost three - quarters of these wanted something more practical rather than simply smaller			0
of those who would consider a move , half would look into buying a bungalow and a quarter would consider a purpose - built retirement apartment			0
