by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:55 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 15:33 est , 19 december 2012 @entity4 spin doctors cooked up a plan to save their boss @entity6 by dumping blame for the @entity9 fiasco onto the @entity11 editor @entity10 , it emerged today			1
they decided that sacrificing mr @entity10 - and thereby providing ‘ a scalp ’ - was the ‘ only way to protect ’ the former director - general			1
the details emerged through text messages which were uncovered by former @entity18 chief @entity17 who carried out a £ 2million investigation into the scandal			1
plan : @entity4 spin doctors cooked up a plan to save their boss @entity6 , left , by dumping blame for the @entity25 on @entity11 editor @entity10 , right it followed the decision by @entity11 to drop an investigation into decades of abuse carried out by @entity9			1
as the crisis engulfed the corporation , the @entity11 editor ’s fate was being mapped out in mobile phone texts between @entity4 press office chiefs			1
one ‘ eye - opening ’ text message suggesting mr @entity10 should quit was sent on october 20 , this year , from @entity37 , the @entity4 ’s head of press , to the director of communications @entity39			1
the text , which referred to an error - strewn blog written by mr @entity10 to explain why @entity11 had axed its @entity44 investigation , said : ‘ thought of the hour : @entity45 ( @entity10 ) changes blog and accepts he was wrong and goes , giving @entity48 a scalp			1
‘ @entity50 ( @entity6 ) then goes into @entity51 ( committee ) saying he backed his editor as you would expect			0
‘ turns out he was wrong but he did the right thing and we all move on ? ? ? scandal : the @entity4 discovered damning evidence that @entity9 was a paedophile but a @entity11 investigation was dropped suddenly two days later , after the blog correction had been made , another message was sent from mr @entity37 to mr @entity39 saying : ‘ think am going to need to brief hard today that @entity45 blog was the basis for all our position on this			1
only way to protect @entity50			0
’ @entity17 said that , by this point , @entity75 ’s now notorious blog had been ‘ regarded by some as a means of insulating the director general from criticism			1
’ @entity77 investigation also showed that the decision to drop @entity11 ’s report into @entity9 ’s decades long campaign of sexual abuse plunged the @entity4 into ' chaos and confusion '			1
@entity17 concluded that management ' proved completely incapable of dealing ' with the fallout			0
' the decision by their editor ( @entity10 ) to drop the original investigation was clearly flawed and the way it was taken was wrong , though i believe it was done in good faith			2
it was not done to protect the @entity44 tribute programme or for any other reason , ' he said			0
findings : the details about the plan to save @entity6 emerged through text messages which were uncovered by former @entity18 chief @entity17 , pictured , who carried out a £ 2million investigation into the scandal to come to this conclusion he examined 10,000 emails and documents which shed light on the events			1
sensationally he found @entity6 was first warned of ‘ the real truth ’ about @entity9 in may 2010 , in an email from @entity4 executive @entity111 - but crucially he failed to ask further questions about it			2
head of events mr @entity114 told @entity116 : ' i understand @entity9 is very ill. we have no obit and i am not sure we would want one			0
' i have a personal interest here : my first job was on a @entity126 ( @entity9 ) show — i know him well and saw the complex and sometimes conflicting nature of the man at first hand — if you know what i mean ! do you have an opinion ? ' he later said : ' i ’d feel v queasy about an obit			0
i saw the real truth ! ! ! ' a later email sent on the day after @entity9 died in october 2011 also warned mr @entity6 about the pervert entertainer – but the man who ran the corporation for 54 days this year claims he never read it			0
commissioning editor for @entity144 and @entity145 told mr @entity6 : ' i gather we did n’t prepare the obit because of the darker side of the story			0
so something celebrating a particular part of his tv career is probably better than the ( life ) story as there are aspects of this which are hard to tell			0
' instead mr @entity6 decided there was no need for a quick obituary and @entity162 controller @entity161 even suggested a special @entity164 edition of @entity165 " ll fix it			0
@entity4 director general @entity6 ( left ) was forced to resign in november over issues surrounding the corporation 's handling of the @entity9 case speaking about the warnings mr @entity17 said today : ' if he had read the email … it would have given mr @entity6 some pause for thought about the planned @entity164 tributes			1
' @entity17 was able to examine texts sent between @entity4 staff so he could get to the bottom of what happened			2
a separate investigation has also revealed why @entity11 later ran a second controversial report , which wrongly linked former @entity183 party chairman @entity182 to child abuse allegations			2
it resulted largely from a failure by members of the team to follow the @entity4 ’s own editorial guidelines , the @entity185 said today			2
the broadcast on november 2 was a ' grave breach which had been costly to all concerned ' and resulted in the public being misled , the @entity185 ’s @entity190 ( @entity191 ) found			0
it also cost @entity6 his job			0
the then director general has a series of disastrous interviews on @entity200 and @entity201 and admitted he did not see the @entity11 show , had missed all tweets linked to it and also the @entity206 front page from the day before			2
that evening he resigned and received a £ 450,000 pay - off for doing the ' honourable thing ' after just 54 days in the job .			0

the text messages were uncovered by @entity17 who carried out an investigation into why @entity11 ditched investigation into @entity214
one text message suggesting mr @entity10 should quit was sent from @entity37 - the @entity4 ’s head of press - to director of communications @entity39
the text said : ‘ thought of the hour : @entity45 ( @entity10 ) changes blog and accepts he was wrong and goes , giving @entity48 a scalp '
