by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:32 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 19 june 2013 @entity3 soared to record levels in april this year as bankers deferred pay outs to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax , new figures suggest			1
labour leader @entity11 challenged @entity12 over the dramatic rise in payouts to business and finance workers , up 64 per cent year - on - year			1
the sharp rise came as the top rate of tax fell from 50p to 45p from the start of april			1
rise : bonus pay rose dramatically in april this year , according to figures from the @entity22 during an intense clash at @entity25 ’s questions , mr @entity11 revealed the figures from the @entity22 which showed that bonuses in the business and financial services this april were 64 per cent higher than a year ago			1
the @entity30 leader said : ‘ the reality is that bonuses are up 64 per cent in april in the @entity33 because he has cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p			1
‘ so people took their bonuses in april and got a massive tax cut as a result			1
' he added : ‘ for all his tough talk the reality is he is dodging his responsibility on banking reform			0
‘ lending is falling , bonuses are rising and while ordinary families are suffering he is giving a tax cut to millionaires			1
’ average weekly bonuses payments in finance and business services were £ 143 in april , up 64.4 per cent on the same time in 2012 and the highest level in records dating back to 2000			1
labour leader @entity11 claimed ordinary families were suffering while tax was being cut for high earners mr @entity12 took aim at @entity30 ’s record in power , blaming them for a failure to regulate			1
the prime minister said : ‘ bankers bonuses were about a third of what they were when he was in the @entity70			2
they have been going down not up			0
’ he said mr @entity11 , and shadow chancellor @entity71 , had questions to answer about their role working for the @entity70 before the financial crash			2
mr @entity12 added : ‘ in 2012 - 13 city bonuses will be 85 per cent lower than they were in 2005 - 08 when those two were working or advising the government with responsibility for regulating the @entity33			2
‘ he can not get over the fact that they presided over the boom and bust and a failure to regulate			0
‘ they can not hide their dreadful record and they should start with an apology			0
’ in january @entity88 abandoned plans to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate			1
the u-turn came hours after @entity95 boss sir @entity94 branded the idea ' depressing ' and accused bankers of mis - judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash			1
the investment bank had considered waiting to award equity bonuses deferred from previous years , due to pay out in january until after april 6			1
but the bank 's @entity103 of the board ruled out the idea			0
prime minister @entity12 said @entity30 had failed to properly regulate the banks before the 2007 crash @entity110 chief executive @entity109 is to become a government minister			2

@entity12 told @entity116 : ' i can announce today that @entity109 , for the past five years chief executive of @entity110 , one of @entity121 's most successful businesses , will take on this vital role			0
' i believe he will bring huge talent to a vital national effort			0
' the row came as a major report recommended that bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for ' reckless misconduct '			2
the new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their ' shocking and widespread malpractice ' , the @entity133 said			2
not a single @entity121 banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash began in 2007 , but the proposed legislation would make sure they would be ' on the hook ' in future , it added			0
as well as prison terms , errant bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services industry , as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being cancelled			1
in the @entity154 , mr @entity12 was pressed on whether he supported the recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties			0
' yes , i do support both of those measures , " he said			0
' obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report			0
' but penalising , including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly , i say yes			0
also , making sure that banks who are in receipt of taxpayers ' money that you can claw back ... bonuses , i say yes too			0
' he said ministers would be using the @entity175 currently going through parliament to implement the plans .			0
