he has already splashed out £ 125,000 on having everything from his calves to his nose surgically transformed but that , it seems , is n't enough for air steward @entity6			1
mr @entity6 , 31 , has flown to @entity7 , where on monday , he went under the knife for a £ 50,000 six - in - one super operation			1
procedures included a £ 13,000 nose job , his fourth so far , a £ 5,000 operation to fix his droopy eyes and another that saw his toes pinned back			1
mr @entity6 , 31 , who lives in @entity32 , has now racked up 30 body - changing operations - including liposuction , six - pack implants and botox fillers - in a quest to achieve the perfect body			1
but with @entity40 doctors unwilling to perform any more surgery , mr @entity6 was forced to approach a specialist @entity43 clinic and fly to @entity44 for bumper operation			1
the lengthy surgery saw three doctors work together to give him the look he wanted , while also completing an £ 8,000 of liposuction operation			2
the fat , which mr @entity6 gained on purpose , was then used in a revolutionary £ 15,000 stem cell procedure which saw the fluid combined with his own blood before being injected back into his hair and skin in a bid to halt the ageing process			1
but despite now having spent a whopping £ 175,000 on his ' dream body ' , the self - confessed perfectionist says that he ’ll never stop going under the knife			2
' it ’s a long process , ' he said			0
' it is long - term maintenance			0
once you start , it is difficult to stop			0
naturally i ’m a perfectionist			0
it ’s like a snowball effect and i ’m not going to stop			0
' it does n’t define the man that i am - i ’m much more than silicone and cosmetic surgery - but once you get started it ’s difficult to stop			2
' i ’m quite hard on myself and i ’m scared of getting old - that ’s the truth			0
' mr @entity6 first went under the knife in 2004 , after feeling too unattractive to fit in with the fashionable friends he had made while studying in @entity32			1
his long list of surgery includes £ 8,000 on botox and fillers , £ 30,000 on three nose jobs , £ 3,000 on liposuction to his jaw and £ 10,000 on pec implants			2
team : dr @entity89 ( left ) , @entity90 and @entity91 ( right ) performed the op for mr @entity6 ready to go : mr @entity6 with his medical team ahead of the operation - his 30th to date unhappy : prior to his first surgery in 2004 , mr @entity6 says he was deeply unhappy with his looks he has also spent £ 22,000 on a fake six pack , £ 7,000 on fillers to his arms , £ 7,000 on hospital bills , £ 7,000 on laser lipo , £ 6,000 on leg lipo and £ 3,000 on calf shaping			1
he also indulges in twice - yearly @entity104 and filler top - ups and takes a cocktail of daily pills consisting of collagen tablets , anti-water retention and hair growth tablets			0
his latest six - and - a - half hour surgery included an operation to repair his nose after permanent fillers in the bridge migrated to the tip of his nose , making it round			2
mr @entity6 also had the cartilage removed from his ear to rebuild his nostrils , which doctors pinned back after they ' got bigger at the age of 27 '			1
quest : mr @entity6 has spent the last decade on his quest to look more like a @entity127 doll expensive : mr @entity6 also spent £ 22,000 on the perfect six pack and £ 10,000 on pec implants the surgery addict also had the skin between his inside lip and gum cut to give him a wider smile , and liposuction in his legs and back , which was re-injected elsewhere in a bid to make him look younger			1
the party - lover insists he works hard to afford the operations with stints as a flight attendant , an image consultant and an event host			0
speaking after the surgery , @entity145 , who will now spend 10 days recovering before the bandages are removed , said : ' the theory of beauty is to look symmetrical			0
' i ’m hopefully going to look more symmetrical after this , and therefore more beautiful			0
it is hard to open my eyes and hard to breathe too but i have a lovely nurse here looking after me			0

@entity6 , 31 , from @entity32 , has spent a total of £ 175,000 on surgery

included a gruesome procedure designed to give him a bigger smile
