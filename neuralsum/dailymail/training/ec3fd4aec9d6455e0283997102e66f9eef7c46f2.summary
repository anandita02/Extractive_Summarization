@entity8 's beef herd needs to go on a diet after gorging on high - sugar grass it 's a time of year when many @entity8 are still struggling to shed those extra pounds they gained over @entity12 and are perhaps pinning hopes on the latest fad , the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet			1
but eating too much , it seems , is not just a problem for humans			2
@entity8 ’s beef cattle have grown overweight after months of feeding on high - sugar grass – and now farmers have been warned to cut their rations			1
dr @entity23 of @entity25 ’s @entity24 , said : ‘ i have never known so many cows across @entity8 to be so overweight			1
they need to be slimmed down urgently			0
’ he said that overweight animals would experience health problems and have difficulty calving , so risking farmers ’ livelihoods			1
the problem has arisen because prolonged sunlight leads to increased sugar levels in grass			0
cattle were able to eat outside for longer during last year ’s fine summer , and when they were moved into sheds for the winter they continued to enjoy their sweet treat in the form of silage made from the grass			0
dr @entity23 added : ‘ it was a season of plenty for cows			0
‘ there is always a greedy cow or two in a herd but i would say this year about 15 to 20 per cent of every herd is too fat			1
these cows are on average at least 176lbs overweight			1
’ the bovine equivalent of a beer belly or muffin top is a fatty layer around the tail			1
dr @entity23 said : ‘ it ’s as if someone has put the cow ’s tail through a big @entity63 mint and put it on the cow ’s back			1
‘ the trouble is that farmers see their cows every day and do n’t really notice if they ’ve grown or put on excess weight			0
so they need to take a friend or a vet to look at them			0
‘ if the cows are too fat they will be too tired to give birth			2
calves may die and in extreme cases , cows will die , too			0
‘ this causes a massive welfare problem and is a huge loss to the farmer – probably about £ 2,000 per animal			0
‘ it is very difficult to get rid of fat , so the quicker the farmers put their cows on a diet the better			2
’ healthier cows : there is always one or two greedy cows in a herd , says dr @entity23 of @entity25 's @entity24 , but at the moment some 15 to 20 per cent of the whole of @entity8 's beef herd is too fat @entity93 , farm manager at @entity5 near @entity6 , admitted that 40 out of 100 cattle at the site were overweight and he urged fellow farmers to face up to the problem			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve got about four weeks before calving begins			2
we ’re weighing our cows regularly to get them fit			0
you can easily see that some of them are far too fat			2
’ typically , a cow on a diet will eat 22lbs of straw a day , 4.4lbs of meal and drink seven gallons of water			0
@entity110 , director of the @entity111 , said : ‘ this is a timely reminder for farmers to keep an eye on the condition of their cows			0

overweight animals could suffer health problems and have difficulty calving
bovine equivalent of a muffin top is a fatty layer around the tail
it is *thought* that around 15 to 20 per cent of @entity8 's beef herd is too fat
