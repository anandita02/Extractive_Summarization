cost - cutting @entity1 officials are coming under fire after three people have fallen into manholes because of the authority 's insistence on using cheap plastic covers			1
the cheap alternatives look similar to the metal manhole covers , apart from the fact that they are bright green or blue			2
locals say they easily break when stepped on , resulting in at least three accidents in @entity14 , the capital of the eastern @entity16 province of @entity17			0
the dodgy plastic manhole covers have been blamed for at least three recent accidents in @entity14 @entity1 officials blame motorists for driving over the plastic covers and weakening them party officials say the covers are weakened by motorists driving over them and they are more than strong enough to bear the weight of ordinary pedestrians - who should realise ' this is n't something to walk on ' in the latest incident , @entity16 woman @entity30 , 43 , hurt her leg when a manhole cover broke			1
she managed to avoid falling all the way down the hole by grabbing onto the side and being helped out by other pedestrians			0
local media said that the thin plastic covers are no more than 7mm thick , and that there have been several incidents where they have broken after people walked on them			1
party officials in @entity14 however have defended the decision to use the plastic covers			1
local party spokesman @entity49 , 46 , said : ' the plastic lids are thin but they have steel bars through them which means they are more than enough to bear the weight of an ordinary pedestrian			0
' the accidents happened by people illegally driving their cars onto the pavement which weakened the lids , causing these accidents			2
' the manhole covers look similar to metal alternatives , except they are coloured bright green or blue although they have metal bars running through them , they are very flimsy and usually only 7mm thick he said that in areas where there was a danger the cars could possibly drive onto the pavement the plastic lids would be replaced but there were still deemed perfectly okay as long as it was only pedestrians that crossed over them			0
he added : ' they are made in brightly coloured material so people really should realise that this is n't something to walk on although if they do we do n't anticipate problems under normal conditions			0
