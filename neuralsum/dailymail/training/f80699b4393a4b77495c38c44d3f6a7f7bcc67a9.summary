' the second dramatic incident for @entity1 in just eight months ( she rolled her @entity90 in @entity91 in june and recorded a blood alcohol level of 0.181 ) will no doubt come as a blow to the socialite and businesswoman , who has been working hard building her active wear label @entity75 over the past few years			1
it seemed like she could finally put the incident behind her last week when she glowed with pride as model @entity100 paraded pieces from the upside down the runway at the @entity54 @entity53 / @entity52 collection launch , @entity1 sipping water and staying close to the side of her fiance throughout the night			2

no conviction was recorded crash : @entity1 collided with three parked cars when she rolled her @entity90 in @entity91 on june 21 last year choosing to stick to water was surely no coincidence at the 43 - year - old 's first public appearance since she faced court in august , the former wife of billionaire @entity125 no doubt hoping to repair her image as a clean - living fashionista			1
in court over the drink driving case , which resulted in @entity1 not having a conviction recorded and receiving a 12 - month driving ban and a fine for $ 1,100 , her solicitor @entity25 said @entity1 had been ' haunted ' by her marriage to @entity125 , which lasted from 1999 until they separated in 2002			1

mr @entity25 said ms @entity1 had not made any money from @entity75 , had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to a @entity197 orphans charity , the @entity196			0
' every garment that is sold by that business , a payment is made to the @entity197 trust , ' he said			0

' a-list : @entity1 and then husband @entity125 in 2001 at a @entity212 function @entity213 lived : sadly the pair were not able to survive the tumultuous time of @entity125 ' failing one - tel business , and the pair announced their separation on 2002 she sold @entity180 , the swimwear label she founded in 2000 during her marriage to @entity125 , to surfwear giant @entity181 in 2007 for an amount reported to be between $ 3 and $ 5 million , staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties			1
@entity1 married @entity125 in a lavish ceremony said to have cost $ 10 million , but memories of the reported 750 guests and private two - hour show by @entity230 could n't sustain their feelings through three tumultuous years , and the couple split in a blaze of publicity in 2002			1
the year before , @entity125 suffered through the collapse of the communications business one - @entity236 out of his shadow : the brunette formed her own public identity in the wake of the marriage breakdown , becoming one of @entity55 's top socialites and making a name for herself as a designer ( pictured 2006 ) clean living : the passionate yogi and paddle boarder showed off her slender frame at an event in 2010 once the fourth - largest telecommunications company in @entity254 , it collapsed dramatically and ended owing up to $ 350 million			2

but life in the spotlight did n't suit @entity1 , who famously failed to show up for the series live finale of @entity266 of which she was the host in 2008 because of paralysing stage fright , leaving the @entity269 to step in at the eleventh hour and save the day , crowning that year 's winner , @entity270			0

the pup was rumoured to have come from a litter from media mogul and then father - in - law @entity293 's rottweiler pet			0
tied the knot ? @entity1 was happy to wear what appears to be a wedding band next to her engagement ring as she stepped out in @entity55 ’s @entity299 on saturday , two days before the domestic incident with @entity0			2
