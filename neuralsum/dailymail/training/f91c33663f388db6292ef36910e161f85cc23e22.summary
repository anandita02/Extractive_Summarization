by @entity0 a widely - used germ - killing ingredient in soaps , deodorants and even toothpaste has been banned in @entity5 over fears that the chemical has a negative effect on users health and the environment			1
governor @entity11 on friday signed a bill to make @entity5 the first state to prohibit the use of triclosan in most retail consumer hygiene products			1
@entity17 is used in an estimated 75 per cent of anti-bacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold across the @entity20 , according to the @entity21			1
the federal agency announced last year that it would revisit the safety of triclosan and other germ - killing ingredients used in personal cleaning products			1
making a move : @entity17 is used in an estimated 75 per cent of anti-bacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold across the @entity20 but now @entity5 wants to ban its use while triclosan has n't been shown to be hazardous to humans , studies have raised concerns that it can disrupt hormones critical for reproduction and development , at least in lab animals , and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria			1
action : governor @entity11 signed a bill enacting the ban but it will not go into effect until 2017 the @entity5 ban is n't due to take effect until january 1 , 2017 but one of its lead sponsors , state senator @entity49 , predicted monday that the odds are good that most manufacturers will phase out triclosan by then anyway			1
mr @entity49 , a @entity53 , said other states and the federal government are likely to act , too			0
he added that some companies are already catching on that there 's no marketing advantage to keeping triclosan in its products , citing how @entity61 's crest toothpaste is now marketing itself as triclosan - free			1
critics including the @entity21 say there 's no evidence that triclosan soaps are any more effective than washing with plain soap and water for preventing the spread of diseases			2
a @entity71 study published last year found increasing levels of triclosan in the sediments of several lakes , and that the chemical can break down in those waters into potentially harmful dioxins			2
two months later , @entity11 ordered all state agencies to stop buying hand soaps and dish and laundry cleaners containing triclosan			0
the @entity82 had urged @entity83 to veto the new bill , saying triclosan has been thoroughly researched and shown to provide important health benefits			2
' instead of letting federal regulators do their jobs , the legislation would take safe , effective and beneficial products off the shelves of @entity5 grocery , convenience and drug stores , ' @entity86 , the trade group 's vice president and counsel for governmental affairs , wrote in a letter to @entity83			2
@entity82 spokesman @entity99 said @entity5 is the only state to enact a ban so far			0
he said it remains to be seen whether any individual manufacturers would go to the expense of reformulating their products just for the @entity5 market or simply stop selling them in the state			2
he said triclosan is an issue best regulated at the federal level			0
key ingredient : while triclosan has n't been shown to be hazardous to humans , studies have raised concerns that it can disrupt hormones critical for reproduction and development , at least in lab animals , and contribute to the development of resistant bacteria under an @entity21 rule proposed in december , manufacturers of anti-bacterial hand soaps and body washes would have to demonstrate that their products are safe for daily use , and more effective than plain soap and water			1
otherwise , they would need to reformulate these products or remove anti-bacterial claims from the labels			0
the agency is still taking public comments on the proposal			0
some manufacturers have announced plans over the last couple years to at least partially phase out triclosan			0
@entity61 plans to finish dropping the chemical from its products this year			0
@entity142 plans to eliminate it from all its consumer products by 2015 .			0

@entity17 is an chemical with *antibiotic* properties and is used in 75 per cent of all liquid soap and body washes

certain products have already started advertising themselves as being triclosan - free
@entity5 governor signed the bill into *law* but it wo n't go into effect until 2017
