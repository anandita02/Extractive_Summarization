the mother lived a comfortable lifestyle and chose ' to line [ her ] pockets from the state ' a nurse lied to obtain £ 92,000 in tax credits and lavished the money on luxury holidays , a holiday chalet and a pet pony for her daughter			1
@entity11 , 46 , a mother - of - three , had claimed she was a single parent and that two of her children , who are all profoundly deaf , were receiving the highest level of disability living care allowance			1
but in reality she was living a very comfortable lifestyle with her police officer husband , @entity20 , and only one of her children was receiving the top rate @entity23			2
she brazenly continued her lies for seven years before eventually being caught out by @entity25 in march 2011			2
judge @entity26 jailed her for 12 months today at @entity27 after investigations revealed that she had been living the high life with her ill - gotten gains @entity20 had been using the money to book family holidays to @entity34 @entity33 , @entity35 and a @entity37 cruise			2
ironically , despite her claims to be single , she celebrated her wedding anniversary while in @entity35 and had booked another @entity37 cruise shortly before @entity25 fraud investigators discovered what she was up to			2
she also had a half share in a holiday chalet in a prime spot in @entity46 , @entity47 , where chalets can be worth up to £ 185,000			1
she had bought a jet ski after she and her husband had completed the relevant qualifications			1
@entity20 denied the charges but was convicted after a trial and had been due to be sentenced last month			2
the hearing was adjourned after the judge was told she could pay all the money back			2
her barrister , @entity57 , today revealed that she had paid £ 92,075 to @entity25 the day after her last appearance and urged the judge to suspend any prison sentence			1
comfortable : the close where @entity20 lived comfortably with her husband and children but after outlining the circumstances of the case judge @entity26 concluded : ' there has to be an immediate custodial sentence			0
' he accepted evidence that her and her husband had short times of separation ' but for the overwhelming majority of this period your husband was living with you in that household			0
' @entity77 had been a district nurse in a position of responsibility and relatively high grade income and her husband was a serving police officer and earning a similarly reasonable income , he said			2
' so this is not a case that very frequently comes before the courts of people on the breadline or just above trying to keep their head above the water and making false claims			0
' you with your twin sources of income had a relatively comfortable background			0
the only conclusion that can be drawn is you lined your pockets from the state			0
' when the authorities came to search your particular premises there outside was a @entity103 with a personalised plate and a jet ski			1
' you are someone with a four bedroom home with ensuite bathroom to the main bedroom , walk in closet and a half - share in a holiday home on the @entity111 , @entity46 , said to be a very desirable place			1
' exclusive : chalets in the @entity111 , @entity46 , which @entity77 held a share in , can sell for up to of £ 185,000 houses on the same road as @entity119 , in @entity120 , @entity121 - are worth an average of £ 260,000			1
he said that there had been holidays to @entity126 , @entity37 cruises and @entity35 and her 14 - year - old daughter has a pony and goes show jumping			1
he said that @entity77 , who has no previous convictions , is no longer in nursing but has set up her own business as a nurse prescriber in the cosmetic side of care			0
he accepted that she has long standing depressive illness and that all her children have severe disabilities but pointed out that her sons are 19 and 20 and in higher education			0
while it was said her children need her , her husband had been able to change his shift pattern when they were younger and he is available to provide them with care , said judge @entity26			0
in one financial year - 2004/2005 - she received £ 13,715 in tax credits when she was actually entitled to just £ 26			1
in another year , after again maintaining her circumstances had not changed , she should have received £ 535 but actually obtained £ 13,688 , said @entity153 , prosecuting			1
' she provided a thoroughly dishonest account of her situation in her application renewals and in telephone calls to the helpline			0
' while claiming to be separated from her husband they opened bank accounts together , went on holiday and were involved in various businesses together			1
' two laptops and a memory stick were seized after her arrest and they contained photographs of the family together enjoying holidays			0
text messages spoke of purchasing a watch in @entity35 and referred to her ‘ hubby ’ , ' said miss @entity153			0
@entity20 declined to answer questions after her arrest and denied she had been untruthful			0
mr @entity57 said that @entity77 ’s new business as a nurse prescriber involves cosmetic procedures such as @entity179 , but if jailed her registration would lapse and she will not be able to renew it			0
he said that her original claim for tax credits was legitimate so it was not a case that was fraudulent from the outset			0
he explained that @entity20 , who was a nurse in general practice for 20 years , had managed to raise the £ 92,075 she needs to repay by various means including her childrens ’ savings , disposing her half share in the chalet and her oldest son has sold his car .			1
