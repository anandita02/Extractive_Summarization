urbanised areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size , according to a new study			1
researchers studied the ' births ' of thunderstorms - known as storm initiations - between 1997 and 2013 and found a significant increase in densely populated areas such as @entity11			1
and this has been tied to the increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas in the same geographical location			1
by studying the ' births ' of thunderstorms ( stock image ) - officially known as storm initiations - experts have found they occur more frequently in urbanised areas			1
this is tied to increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas of the same size in the same goegraphical location researchers from @entity31 studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast @entity34 between 1997 and 2013			1
they found that urbanised areas such as @entity11 are 5 per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms , on a given day , than rural areas of the same size			1
' per year , that amounts to two or three more thunderstorms of the pop - up variety , ' explained lead researcher @entity41			2
' these originate over the city or downwind and are separate from large and more easily predicted weather events			0
' storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months , in july and august , in the late afternoon and early evening			1
and the study found more ' births ' occurred during the week than at weekends			2
these findings add further weight to the fact rising temperatures increase the frequency of storms , but also that increased pollution levels in urban areas play a major role			1

they found that urbanised areas such as @entity11 are 5 per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms , on a given day , than rural areas of the same size during the week , more businesses and factories produce emissions than at weekends , for example			1
rural areas showed no significant differences between weekdays and weekends			1

in addition to pollution , the study said urbanised areas cause more storms because they create ' urban heat - islands '			1
concentrations of buildings can increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities , compared to high pressures in rural areas			1
this causes a so - called ' low - level atmospheric convergence ' , which forces air up into thunderstorms			2
buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds , which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air			2

' city planners , meteorologists and citizens who live in or near large urban areas should be aware of the increased risk , ' mr @entity41 continued			0
' these storms can produce dangerous weather hazards , including lightning , hail , strong winds and flash floods , often with little or no warning			0
' as air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the @entity143 , the air mass near the surface ' absorbs ' water through evaporation			0
the warmer the air mass , the more water it takes up , and as it reaches the @entity143 , it begins to rise through the atmosphere , eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space			0
cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air , so as the air cools , condensation occurs , and heat is released			0
when enough heat is released , air begins to rise even further , pulling more air behind it , which ultimately causes a thunderstorm			0
as a result , many experts predict that global warming will cause the number of thunderstorms to increase and they are often used as indicators of rising temperatures and climate change			1
thunderstorms get energy from the heat released by the condensation of water vapour ( illustrated )			0
using climate records , and simulations up to 2098 , experts recently said warming will create more precipitation and less circulation			2
the number of storms will stay the same , but they will become more intense however , earlier this month a separate study found that instead of increasing in number , storms will increase in intensity as the globe gets warmer - meaning the same number of storms will occur , but they 'll be stronger			2
researchers from the @entity195 explained that the @entity197 's atmosphere needs fuel to work , which in this instance is energy from the sun. as air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the @entity143 , the air mass near the surface ' absorbs ' water through evaporation			0
the warmer the air mass , the more water it takes up , and as it reaches the @entity143 , it begins to rise through the atmosphere , eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space			0

when enough heat is released , air begins to rise even further , pulling more air behind it , which ultimately causes a thunderstorm			0
the ' output ' of this atmospheric engine , and storms , is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the @entity143 and the @entity231			0
the physicists said that this is because global warming will directly affect how the atmosphere circulates air mass , heat and water using what 's been dubbed ' @entity197 's heat engine			0
' @entity241 and his colleagues from the @entity195 compared climate records from 1981 to 2012 with climate simulations			0
this comparison revealed that a third of the atmospheric energy is typically involved with the movement of water through the cycle			0
but , as a result of climate change , the atmosphere is expected to use more energy during this part of the cycle			2
this is because the air will be warmer , so will take up more water , which will create more evaporation and precipitation			0
by using more energy to move the water , less energy is used to circulate the air mass , and an increase in water vapour , put simply , will make the process less efficient			0
the atmosphere still needs to get rid of the precipitation it collects , but because circulation is affected , it has to do this in fewer , more intense storms			0
air masses that are able to reach the top of the atmosphere are strengthened , while those that ca n't , are weakened .			0

researchers studied radar data in the southeast @entity34 from 1997 to 2013
they found that urbanised areas such as @entity11 are 5 *%* more likely to be hit by thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size
experts said this shows ' human - induced climate change ' at the local *scale*
storms were significantly common on weekdays compared with weekends
this *suggests* weekday pollution levels could play a role in storms
rural areas showed no differences between weekdays and weekends
