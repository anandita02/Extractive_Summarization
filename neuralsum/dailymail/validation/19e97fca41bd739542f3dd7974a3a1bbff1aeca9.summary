47 - year - old @entity19 , who hails from @entity37 , had been married before and was looking for the love of his life			1
he knew straight away that 38 - year - old @entity20 was different to the other five women he had been on dates with from the site			1
' i liked the idea of @entity9 because you could put in all the information about yourself and who you are and what you ’re looking for in life and what your interests are , ' @entity19 told @entity18			1
' i did it for about a year and i was at the end of it and starting to get discouraged a little bit because i was just going through this series of meet ups and dates and they just were n't going anywhere			0
all of a sudden , @entity20 , who was born in the @entity61 in the @entity62 , came into his life			2

@entity20 , who is an it professional was interested in @entity93 , while @entity19 , who works in @entity94 , was obsessed with motorcycles according to the findings , men with an interest in politics are considered the most attractive to women , followed by those with an interest in travel , health and exercise , food and theatre			1
on the flipside , the top five hobbies and interests listed by women that are most likely to capture men ’s attention are personal growth , health and exercise , food , family and dancing			1
however , @entity20 disputes these findings and said politics would not be on the top of her list when looking for the perfect partner			1
' politics has no effect on how i felt about anyone , ' she said			2
' for me it was having a varied interest			0
i looked at the outdoors so somebody who liked that as well			0
you just want to see that somebody has interest in a few different areas			0
' while @entity20 said exercise was important , she believes some of the men on the site put too much emphasis on their physique			2
@entity20 believes men who come across like they only have one interest are a major turn - off and show that they do not have time in their lives for anything else ' i noticed when i was on @entity9 most of the guys would upload a photo of when they are overseas , a photo where they 're exercising , ' she said			1
' men will try and make themselves seem more active than they were so they would make out like they cycled all the time or lifted weights everyday , when that ’s not really the truth			0
' people do try and demonstrate that they have varied interests on the site			0
although dating was n't always plain sailing on the site for @entity20 and @entity19			1
while one woman had posted on her profile saying she did n't have any kids , she suddenly revealed to @entity19 on one of their dates that she actually had an 18 - year - old son			2
@entity20 found out the hard way that one man was n't exactly mr @entity196 after he failed to let her know he was still living with his ex-girlfriend			2
@entity19 was different - he made @entity20 laugh and had the same life goals as her			1
' we just clicked straight away , ' she said			0
@entity19 said he was very honest with @entity20 very early on , that way there was no confusion or secrets to be found out later			1
the pair were married within eight months of meeting and now have a one and a half year old daughter called @entity115 ' i was always up front			2
it actually scared some women away because i came on too full on			0
it scared away the fails and my attitude was : why else are you on this thing unless you ’re planning on settling down ? , ' he said			0
' i think there ’s a lot of fear and doubt out there and they ’re scared and people so much want to impress somebody and fall in love with somebody , they ’re willing to fudge the truth in the beginning			0
' really the best way to get in the door is just to be upfront and truthful in the beginning and that way the right doors open not the wrong doors			0
' both @entity20 and @entity19 believe many people 's profiles can be a major turn - off , with @entity19 claiming women who paraded their wine glasses on their cover photo turned him away			1
' there ’s a high number of women who put their profile photo up of them drinking			0
i do n’t want to judge but i ’m sober , so when i saw that it was a turn - off , it kind of gives the wrong impression , ' he said			0

' a lot of men on the profile said they were into football , ' she said			0
' really sports mad is really off - putting , especially for me because i do n’t like going to sports games			0
' a lot of men would really push it			0
one of the questions was : what are your five favourite things ? and some of them would put football for all five			0
i 'm sure they thought it was funny but it was just an immediate no. ' though the findings suggest that personal hobbies and interests can have an impact on how we ’re perceived by the opposite sex , @entity9 matches its members based on core personality traits and values , which , in the long run , are far more significant than superficial factors like hobbies which evolve over time .			1

a new study by @entity9 show hobbies that attract the opposite sex
men prefer women who are interested in their own personal growth
women are drawn to men who are able to hold a *conversation* on politics
@entity19 and @entity20 met on the dating website
