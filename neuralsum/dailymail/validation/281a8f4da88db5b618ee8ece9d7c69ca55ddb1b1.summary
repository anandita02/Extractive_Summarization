@entity0 attempted to rob the bookmakers by claiming the tin of pilchards he was carrying was a bomb a hopeless robber has been spared jail after he tried to hold up a bookmaker 's shop with a tin of pilchards			1
@entity0 , 18 , owed a friend £ 1,800 and spent the day ploughing his last pennies into roulette machines hoping to win the money until he was down to his last pound			1
the 6ft 4in teenager then hit upon a plan to rob the bookies , where he was a regular customer			0
he bought a 99p tin of @entity24 pilchards from his local corner shop and burst into a @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , on 20 december last year			1
@entity0 demanded cash and claimed the tin of fish in tomato sauce he had in a black bag was a lethal explosive device , @entity29 heard			1
' i 've got a bomb , ' he told astonished cashier @entity38 , who simply walked off into a secure room at the back of the shop			1
@entity0 hurled his fishy snack across the shop in frustration and left			2
mr @entity38 had recognised him and @entity0 was arrested shortly afterwards , confessing to his bungled plan immediately at the police station			2
he admitted attempted robbery and one count of communicating false information about a bomb hoax			2
@entity51 , prosecuting , said : ' in respect of the bomb hoax , this was n't a classic bomb hoax in that the security services were n't alerted and there 's no evidence that any action was taken by the authorities			0
' both my learned friend and i agree that this is best dealt with as an attempted robbery - you can say you have a knife or a gun , in this case it was a tin of pilchards masquerading as a bomb			1
' judge @entity69 remarked : ' the thing that moved the man behind the counter to go behind the safe and into the secure room was undoubtedly the belief that the defendant had a bomb			1
' @entity77 , defending , said @entity0 he had been suffering from diagnosed but untreated depression and psychosis at the time of the incident , and has @entity82			2
' these are serious offences and i accept the custody threshold has been passed , and normally these types of offences would merit an immediate sentence of imprisonment			0
' she continued : ' he 's far from someone who fits the profile of a robber of a small business , it 's a great irony that @entity0 went into a bookmaker somewhere he frequented , somewhere he was known - he knew the man behind the counter			1
' she added that @entity0 's own mother also works at a bookies , and the fact that he chose to rob a similar premises to his mother 's indicated he ' had n't given it much thought '			1
in a letter to the judge , @entity0 wrote : ' i just want the judge to know i need help and i will be an outstanding member of my community			2
' ms @entity77 added : ' this was entirely out of character , this was an aberration in this young man 's life			0
' @entity0 was attempting to rob the @entity26 in @entity27 ( pictured ) , which he had frequented as a customer sentencing @entity0 to a two - year suspended sentence , two year 's supervision by the probation service and ordering him to undergo mental health treatment , judge @entity69 said : ' there can be absolutely no doubt that what you did was to commit a very serious offence			1
' the court heard @entity0 threw the tin of pilchards across the shop in frustration when his plan to pretend it was a bomb failed he added : ' one can only imagine how petrified he must have been			1
' you secreted this item in a black bag , no doubt to give it a more convincing air to what you were doing			0
' he continued : ' you are young man suffering from a number of psychological conditions that had gone untreated , but you had got to the age of 18 without having descended into criminal activity			0
' the disorders from which you suffered were long standing disorders and one can only commend members of your family for being able to cope for so long			0
' it is in that context i have to decide how i want to deal with you , i 'm satisfied that the custody threshold has been passed - what i am about to do is exceptional and does not reduce the gravity of your offence you committed			0
' i am persuaded that i can suspend the sentence			0
' judge @entity69 also barred him from an betting shop for the next 12 months and ordered him to pay a £ 100 surcharge			0
@entity0 , of @entity27 , wiped away tears as his sentence was read out and thanked the judge before leaving the dock			0
one of @entity0 's family members shouted ' you are a just and a fair man your honour ' as the judge left the bench .			0
