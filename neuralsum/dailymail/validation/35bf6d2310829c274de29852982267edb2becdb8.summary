could you work with your mother every day ? one @entity3 student did just that - ditching a degree in @entity5 and @entity6 to come and work in his mum 's cafe			2
@entity10 , 52 , runs the @entity11 and @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , with her son @entity15			1
@entity15 , 24 , started working at the business while on a summer holiday from @entity3 and enjoyed the role so much that he packed in his course and became joint manager of the store , taking control of the ice cream - making side of the business			1
@entity10 ( left ) displays some of her home baked cakes , while @entity15 shows off his ice cream ( right ) @entity10 tells @entity31 in her own words why she thinks her son made the right decision and explains how they have n't looked back since ... she says : every middle class @entity37 wants her child to go to university and when @entity15 got a place to read @entity5 and @entity6 at @entity3 i was thrilled			1
' i 've got two degrees myself and though they have n't done me a bit of good in the workplace i had fun getting them and the one i got from the @entity49 while i was at home bringing up the kids kept me sane and my brain ticking over when i was immersed in child rearing			2
' my jobs have always been low pay and hands on practical , mostly retail management and estate agency			2
@entity15 and @entity10 ' i figured with @entity15 if the worst came to the worst the language would always come in useful and he could get a job as an air steward ! ( yes , i had a brief spell as an air hostess myself ) ' we opened @entity65 on an absolute shoe string and as @entity15 was home for @entity68 from @entity3 i employed him to help scrub floors , scrape walls , paint , paper and clean			1
' it was hard , boring , work and @entity15 was not the best employee , he tended to get bored easily or give up if things got difficult			1
' i was paying him a wage so technically he should have done as he was told but if it 's your kid it 's not always as easy as all that : you have to maintain the relationship no matter what and you ca n't sack them ! ' a year on and the business was going well , having worked in retail management i was used to handling staff but i was surprised to find that staffing was turning into my biggest headache			1
' maybe i 'm naive and too willing to trust but i found myself being ripped off , cheated and lied to			2
' i was paying above minimum wage , providing paid sickness and holidays , treating my staff with consideration and respect			2
' but i was discovering that they were opening late and closing early when i was n't there , claiming for hours they had n't worked , taking days off sick when they were perfectly well and sitting around on their phones or the work laptop when i was paying them to work			2
' by august of that summer it was time to bite the bullet and sack my only full time member of staff			2
' he was claiming to be ill , i was paying him sickness benefit and working seven days a week to provide cover and i discovered he was n't actually ill at all , he just did n't fancy coming into work			1
' the afternoon i finally got up the courage to sack him i was upset and worried , another staffing disaster , who could i turn to now ? who could i trust to love and understand my business as i did ? @entity15 is very creative with his ice cream flavours ' @entity120 demands a very personal touch , it 's all about word of mouth , friendships , trust and kindness			1
' i always tell my staff the only thing you can do wrong here ( apart from stealing of course ! ) is be rude to a customer			2
' there is very little footfall here and we rely on repeat business and word of mouth			1
' it 's hands - on hard work , you have to be smiley and polite all the time and we provide a lot of bereavement counselling and childcare advice			2
' we find people jobs and nannies , locate lost pets and impart cooking tips and marriage guidance			0
' @entity15 and i were doing @entity151 night that night : every so often we pick a food theme and sell 20 tickets to an evening meal			1
this one involved bbq and homemeade baked beans , cornbread and ' slaw			0
@entity10 behind the counter at the shop ' we were in the backyard lighting the bbq when he told me that i did n't need to worry too much about finding another full timer : he was planning on giving up @entity163 and working for me full time			1
' actually i was delighted , relieved and delighted , then i felt guilty			0
surely i should be putting his education before my business ? ' i knew his father ( we 're divorced ) would be furious			1
' i knew he was n't happy at @entity3 , the course was n't really what he 'd hoped , he was a bit older than his classmates ( he 'd done a gap year in @entity5 ) and the next year would bring another year in @entity5 which he really did n't want to do			0
' he was ready to settle down into a proper job in one place and put down some roots			0
he also wanted to be part of building the business			1
' i 'm very keen to get my other two children into the business but they are resisting for some reason ! ' it 's funny to think now but @entity15 has always been a home bird			1
@entity15 selling his ice cream on a summer afternoon ' he absolutely hated leaving me to go to nursery and although he got on well at school and had a lovely girlfriend for years he was never one for going out and socialising much , he just always liked being at home			1
' i guess @entity65 is an extension of that , it is very cosy and homely ! ' @entity15 took over the ice cream making which was a massive relief for me as it is very sticky , hard work and labour intensive			1
' he soon displayed a real genius for it			0
its quite technical as you have to get the right balance of fat and sugar and its something that demands a lot of expertise and know how			0
' if you come up with a flavour he will know how to turn it into ice cream ! ' i 'm quite good at coming up with flavours , i 'm a cook and i know food and what works with what , and i listen to my customers and what they 'd like to try			0
@entity15 is brilliant at translating those ideas into ice cream			1
' i know i can trust him 100 per cent - he has bought shares in the business and although i am technically the boss ( i am his mum ! ) we have equal shares			1
@entity219 and @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 ' he is as passionate about making @entity65 work as i am , he loves our customers and our product as much as i do , we are family ! ' i know our customers really identify with us as a family business , they love the way we interact - although i was once accused of having an incestuous relationship with him ! ' it does have its down side ! if i get angry with him i get furious , and he is the same , we are both pretty volatile and he always knows how to drive me nuts			1
' i have to be really careful about respecting boundaries also , allowing him to have proper time off and not ask him to do more than a regular employee			0
' i 'm also aware that sometimes i make excuses for him , cut him too much slack and let him get away with things i should n't			0
' he is always going to be my baby boy : even though he 's over six foot with a big beard ! ' we both like looking after people , i think that 's why we work so well together			0
i still get a rush when i enter the front of house and every seat is taken , each table filled with people happy to be eating delicious , home - made food and fresh gelato			0
we both take a great joy in providing a service that is becoming rarer to find nowadays : a friendly , independent place to be ; not only existing within the local community but comprising a major part of it			0
the fact that @entity37 loves to cook makes us a good team			0
it means that she can stay in the kitchen , cook three cakes and a quiche and knock out lunches at > the same time ( seriously , she is that quick and organised , ) and i can look after the front of house , making coffee and serving ice cream and cake			0
we 're an efficient machine because we know where each other 's strengths lie			0
of course , that also means i get tetchy when i see her making coffee : i 'm a perfectionist with more experience behind the machine , but you try telling your mum she 's not making that latte the correct way			0
why would i give up a university degree to work with my mum ? let 's be honest , what 's the job market like for graduates nowadays ? not great			1
i was halfway through a four year degree and i knew that the situation was n't likely to improve			0
this was a chance to become part of something huge , and the company needed me			0
i had gradually usurped the role of ice cream maker from mum ( to be honest , i think she was secretly glad ) and had got to the point where i could tell the temperature of the gelato in the machine by sound alone			0
i believed in the product 100 per cent and still do : no one else is doing innovative , artisan gelato the way we do it , and our business growth speaks for itself : we now have a dedicated factory , as well as an art gallery / gift shop			1
i love working with my hands , directly contributing to the success of our own endeavour			2
and even though i know i 'm an equal shareholder , i still get surprised when mum asks me what i think we should do in a certain situation			0
it 's really cool owning an ice cream company .			0
