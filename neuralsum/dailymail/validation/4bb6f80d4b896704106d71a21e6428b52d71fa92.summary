' i still really believe the surgery saved her life , ' her 35 - year - old mom @entity16 told people			0
' i do n't even know if we would be here			0
seeing her do a @entity23 was just icing on the cake			0
last year , the 13 - year - old underwent gastric sleeve surgery to help her lose more than 50lbs last year , competing in a race would have been impossible for @entity5 , who was almost always in pain because of her size			1
she began rapidly gaining weight after she sought treatment for her rare brain tumor in 2011 ; the surgery to remove the benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus and led to the development of hypothalamic obesity			1
after gaining 150lbs over the course of two years she developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity - related problems			0
@entity5 had the life - saving surgery last march , but due to complications doctors were forced to perform a gastric sleeve surgery instead of the scheduled gastric bypass			1
feeling better : @entity5 , who suffers from hypothalamic obesity , a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight , posed for the camera in a light pink crochet sweater last august puppy love : @entity5 can be seen cuddling on the couch with her dog last month she returned to school six months later after she lost more than 60lbs			1
but managing @entity5 ' weight is still a constant struggle			2
her mom , who said ' hypothalamic obesity is a beast ' , admitted to the outlet that her daughter had since put eight to 10lbs back on her frame			1
@entity5 continues to take steroids and growth hormones every day because her brain tumor surgery also left her with panhypopituitarism , a syndrome marked by decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones			1
getting stronger : the teen was photographed working out in the gym last may vacation time : @entity5 was all smiles during a trip to the beach although the treatments make her feel ill and cause her to miss school at least once a week , @entity5 is happier than she has been in a long time			2
' @entity5 has a confidence about her that she did n’t have before , ' @entity16 said			2
' she 's gaining independence little by little and becoming her own person			0
' @entity16 also noted that her daughter , who was once home - schooled , now has friends in her class			0
she maintained that , despite the ongoing complications @entity5 is forced to deal with , the surgery was ' really good ' for her			2
' i 'm baffled by how well she does , especially at her age , ' @entity16 said			0
' she 's such a tough girl			0
