eating too much salt may be bad for your heart – but it can protect against skin infections , research has found			1
a high - salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin , boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections , say scientists			1
in an experiment , @entity13 researchers discovered that mice which were fed a high - salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly			1
too much salt may be bad for your heart but it can protect against skin infections , new research found this is because the salt had raised the activity of immune cells called macrophages , making their immune systems more responsive			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity32 , may also highlight how salt was once effectively used to ward off infections before antibiotics were invented			1
professor @entity36 , of the @entity37 , said : ' up to now , salt has been regarded as a detrimental dietary factor ; it is clearly known to be detrimental for cardiovascular diseases , and recent studies have implicated a role in worsening autoimmune diseases			0
' our current study challenges this one - sided view and suggests that increasing salt accumulation at the site of infections might be an ancient strategy to ward off infections , long before antibiotics were invented			0
' high levels of sodium stored in the skin , especially in the elderly , can lead to high blood pressure and increase the risk for heart disease and stroke , worsen autoimmune disease and even increase the risk of stomach cancer			2
professor @entity64 from @entity65 added : ' despite the overwhelming evidence linking dietary salt to disease in humans , the potential evolutionary advantage of storing so much salt in the body has not been clear			0
' a high - salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin , boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections , say scientists the researchers found that infected areas in patients with bacterial skin infections also showed remarkably high salt accumulation			1
but in experiments high salt diet mice had increased immunity against microbial infections by boosting the activity of immune cells called macrophages			1
this meant that mice who had infections in their feet caused by a parasite called leishmania major were able to heal more quickly			2
future studies will examine how salt accumulates in the skin and triggers immune responses , and why salt accumulates in the skin of ageing adults			0
professor @entity36 went on : ' a further understanding of the regulatory cascades might not only help to design drugs that specifically enhance local salt deposition and help to combat infectious diseases , but also may lead to novel strategies to mobilise sodium stores in the ageing population and prevent cardiovascular disease			0
' we also think that local application of high - salt - containing wound dressings and the development of other salt - boosting antimicrobial therapies might bear therapeutic potential			2
' but he warned everyone should not rush off and start a high salt diet			2
he added : ' due to the overwhelming clinical studies demonstrating that high dietary salt is detrimental to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases , we feel that at present our data does not justify recommendations on high dietary salt in the general population			0
' nevertheless , in situations where endogenous accumulation of salt to sites of infection is insufficient , supplementation of salt might be a therapeutic option			0
' but this needs to be addressed in further studies			0
