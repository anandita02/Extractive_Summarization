neanderthals may have created and worn the world 's first jewellery 130,000 years ago , according to scientists			1
researchers examining eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity7 in @entity8 say they were used to create necklace or bracelet			1
the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the @entity0 that once inhabited the site where they were found			1
the eagle talons shown above were found at a site inhabited by @entity0 and are the earliest example of jewellery yet discovered , according to researchers who have re-examined them 100 years after they were found the findings will add to mounting evidence that @entity0 were not the slow - witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as			1
instead they are emerging as having had a sophisticated culture , were highly intelligent and may have even created art. it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient @entity0			1
but the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes			0
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning @entity42 now have roughly 2 per cent @entity0 dna			1
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history			0
however , some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases			0
scientists have found that part of our @entity58 system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from @entity0			1
other researchers have suggested that humans outside @entity64 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with @entity0			2
researchers from @entity68 and @entity69 universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the neanderthal genome			0
a gene that can cause diabetes in @entity76 is also thought to have come from @entity0 , long before their ancestors colonised the @entity78			0
the new findings suggest that the talons may have had a symbolic purpose - something that some anthropologists have argued @entity0 did not possess or copied off modern humans			1
however , dr @entity84 , an anthropologist at the @entity85 who led the study along with colleagues in @entity8 , said the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in @entity42			1
he said : ' it 's really a stunning discovery			0
' it 's one of those things that just appeared out of the blue			0
' it 's so unexpected and it 's so startling because there 's just nothing like it until very recent times to find this kind of jewellery			0
' the eight talons were discovered more than 100 years ago at a site where @entity0 remains have been found just outside the town of @entity7 in northern @entity8			1
the researchers examined the talons and found that four of them bear multiple smooth edged cut marks around the top			1
three of the largest talons also have small notches at roughty the same place along upper area of the talon blade			0
all eight of the talons appear to show signs of polishing			0
the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity126 , say the cut marks are evidence that they talons and connecting bones were cut from the foot of the eagle and attached to a string or sinew			1
along with colleagues at the @entity8 @entity137 , dr @entity84 said : ' these talons provide multiple new lines of evidence for @entity0 ’ abilities and cultural sophistication			1
' they are the earliest evidence for jewellery in the @entity42 fossil record and demonstrate that @entity0 possessed a symbolic culture long before more modern human forms arrived in @entity42			1
our traditional view of @entity0 , shown above in the reconstruction at the @entity137 in @entity152 , is of a primative and stupid species but new evidence suggests they were intelligent and cultured cuts and notches on the talons ( shown above ) suggest they were strung on sinew as a bracelet or necklace ' some have argued that @entity161 lacked symbolic ability or copied this behavior from modern humans			1
' these remains clearly show that the @entity161 made jewelry well before the appearance of modern humans in @entity42 , extending ornament production and symbolic activity early into the @entity170			1
' previously the oldest jewellery to be discovered in the world were some seashells that had showed signs of being used as beads around 100,000 years ago in @entity176 and @entity64 but were thought to have been made by modern humans			1
the new discovery now suggests that @entity179 were also capable to creating jewellery , other sophisticated ' art ' , and may even have had rudimentary religion			2
the talons were discovered at a site inhabited by @entity0 close to the town of @entity7 in northern @entity8 the shells above were found in @entity176 and were thought to be the earliest example of beads that were worn as jewellery - dating to around 100,000 years ago - but the eagle talons predate these by up to 30,000 years previously scientists have found evidence that @entity0 may have created engravings on rocks in @entity195 while modified feathers and shells have also been found alongside their remains			1
researchers believe @entity0 used their mouths as a third hand for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat			0
in july , the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered lent weight to this theory			0
the collection reveals how @entity0 developed their distinctive teeth before their brains , using them as a third hand for holding objects			0
the study adds to theories that the @entity0 evolved their characteristic looks slowly , and intermittently , over hundreds of thousands of years			2
the ancient skulls , dating back 400,000 years , show @entity0 - like features in the face and teeth , while other parts of the skulls , including the brain case , resembled those of more primitive human ancestors			1
this suggests the earliest @entity0 used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects			2
such findings are also raising new questions about how this now extinct branch of the human family tree died out			0
scientists have long believed that they died out as modern humans , @entity237 , moved into the parts of @entity239 and @entity42 where homo neanderthalensis had lived			1
others believe instead that as the climate warmed they were unable to cope or even merged with modern humans through interbreeding			2
dr @entity245 , an anthropologist at @entity246 , said the discovery of the talons shed new light on @entity0 intelligence			2
he said : ' this research gives us two important bits of information about @entity0 and their intelligence levels			0
' one , that they made symbolic objects which clearly means they thought in a very similar way to us , and two , much more importantly , that they were capable of making complex symbolic objects in complete isolation from us			0
' similar evidence from @entity265 dated to around 35,000 years ago is sometimes held up as an example of neanderthals copying us			0
' but the date and location of the @entity7 material means that this is clear evidence of independent @entity0 innovation at its best			0
' the last five years has seen our view of @entity0 revolutionised - it is time to put the stupid cave man image to bed once and for all			2
' neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago , spreading to inhabit much of @entity42 and parts of @entity239 , but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago			2
the reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated homo sapiens			0
they were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age @entity42			0
however , a series of discoveries are now putting @entity0 into a new light			0
stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination			2
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in @entity265 also suggests @entity0 understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the @entity304 in @entity305 suggests that @entity0 may have built homes using the materials they found around them			1
they discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones			2
many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments			0
cross-hatched engravings found inside @entity317 in @entity195 are also thought to be the first known examples of @entity0 rock art. dna analysis has also shown that @entity0 carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak			1
the traditional image of @entity0 as primative creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence			2

eight eagle talons were found at a site in @entity8 inhabited by @entity0
they had cut marks that suggest they had been strung together with sinew
the claws , cut from the feet of a white tailed eagle , had also been polished
anthropologists say it is the oldest example of jewellery to be discovered
they say it suggests @entity0 had used them for a symbolic purpose
the claws predate the arrival of modern humans in @entity42 by 80,000 years
this contradicts traditional views of @entity0 as primitive and stupid
scientists say they were in fact intelligent and had sophisticated culture
