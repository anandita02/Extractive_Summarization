prom is supposed to be one of best nights of the year for high school juniors and seniors , but sometimes it does n't turn out that way			1
looking back at prom photos is sometimes an easy way to see why			1
weird haircuts , strange poses and wardrobe choices that are just wrong await in the latest set of pictures from @entity12			1
is it worse to be her , him or the rug ? maybe they thought it was a magic carpet or something			0
guess not no tuxedo , no trousers , no smile , no problem ... at least the fringe on the jean shorts looks classy there are three chandeliers in the background at this place			0
they did n't help to distract from the foreground maybe the laser show in the background was an attempt to call attention away from the suit			2
it did n't work they had their spot on the dance floor marked off with a stack of telephone books for him to stand on the question is , who ended up with the flowers at the end of the night ? where these guys were so serious looking because they were planning to fight over her after the photo was taken ? when you do n't have a date , the best solution is always to go with a giant fish in a dress the mustache is awesome			2
the jacket and pants are even kind of cool			0
but the chair makes this guy shine at least this guy did n't have to worry about shelling out for a limo or sticking his date with the corsage as soon as the dance was over , they ran off to go compete on @entity68			0
did n't need to change though the sunglasses made it harder for them to see other people , it does n't work the other way around it 's a well - known fact there 's no better way to attract a suitor than by taking a photo with a tractor they seem really , really happy			1
wonder how they would feel if they saw this photo again ? their first date was probably to go see the @entity87 or something else involving @entity89			0
