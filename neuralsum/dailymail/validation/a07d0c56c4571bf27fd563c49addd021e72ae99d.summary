a force field that can protect vehicles from the destructive blastwaves thrown out by explosions has been development by aircraft manufacturer @entity5			1
the company has been granted a patent for a device that appears to work like the fictional shields seen in science fiction movies like @entity11 and @entity12			1
the system works by using an ' arc generator ' to rapidly heat the air in front of a shockwave creating a cloud of electrically charged gas			1
they say the device could be mounted on vehicles such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers , buildings , aircraft , ships and submarines			1
@entity47 military scientists have been working on a new type of armour designed to repel incoming fire from vehicles			0
the armour , developed by researchers at the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) would use pulses of electrical energy to defelct rockets , shrapnel and other ammunition that might damage a vehicle			0
engineers behind the techology claim it is possible to incorporate supercapacitors into the body of a tank or armoured personnell carrier to turn it into a kind of giant battery			0
when incoming fire is detected , the energy stored in the supercapacitor can be rapidly dumped onto the metal plating on the outside of the vehicle , producing a strong electromagnetic field that creates a momentary forecfield capable of repelling incoming metal			0
if timed correctly , the scientists behind the technology say it could help to prevent rocket propelled grenades and shells that detonate on impact from reaching their target			0
they claim the device could work both in the air and underwater , helping to protect assets from rockets , landmines , torpedoes and @entity93			2
writing in the patent , @entity5 said : ' the majority of the damage caused by explosive devices results from shrapnel and shockwaves			2
' damage from shrapnel may be prevented by , for example , physical barriers			0
' shockwaves are travelling discontinuities in pressure , temperature , density and other physical qualities through a medium such as the ambient atmosphere			0
' @entity112 damage is more difficult to prevent because shockwaves can traverse an intermediate medium including physical barriers			0
' damage from shockwaves may be lessened or prevented by interposing an attenuating material between the shockwave source and the object to be protected			2
' @entity121 thrown out from explosions often cause more widespread damage than the immediate blast area , often structural damage to vehicles and buildings			2
the high pressures and temperatures created by shockwaves can also cause secondary explosions			0
recent research has also shown that blastwaves can cause devastating internal injuries to soldiers , particularly when in the enclosed space of a vehicle			0
@entity5 's patent proposes using lasers ( shown above ) or microwaves to create plasma to slow the shockwave @entity5 's patent proposes using sensors that can detect the light or other electromagentic radiation - such as microwaves or infrared light - thrown out by explosion			1
this would then trigger an ' arc generator ' to produce a temporary force field between the vehicle or building and the advancing shockwave			1
it says this could be created using lasers or microwaves to rapidly heat the air in front of the vehicle to produce an area of electrically charged gas , or plasma			1
this change in medium would interfere with the oncoming shockwave and help to deflect its force from hitting the vehicle , says @entity5			2
it also claims that the arc generator could create a powerful electric current within just a few milliseconds to create an electric art through the air			1
this graphic shows how lasers could be used to create a plasma shied protect a vehicle from a shockwave the @entity176 in @entity12 ( pictured ) used a force field to help protect it from torpedos and phaser blasts spacecraft , vehicles and even individual robots in the @entity11 ( pictured ) had their own shields this would heat the gas and change its density to interfere with the path of the shockwave			1
@entity5 also proposes that the arc generator could be a gun that fires multiple pellets on converging paths , leaving a trail of ions in their wake like tracer bullets			1
these would form conductive channels through the air through which a voltage could be traced			0
it also says the arc generator could also fire projectiles training conductive wires that would also heat the air to create a medium that would remove energy from the shockwave			1
the patent said : ' when the shockwave created by an explosion reaches the arc , the shockwave deforms the arc in directions perpendicular to the conductive channels			2
this diagram shows how a arc generator could be mounted onto the side of a vehicle to protect it from a blast ' specifically the shockwave pushes the ionised air created by or making up the arc inward and the current tends to flow where the air is ionised			1
' this movement by the shockwave may do mechanical work against the magentic field force and remove energy from the shockwave making it weaker			2
' it also says that by forming the shield in the shape of a convex lens , it can deflect the energy from the shockwave			0
as the density of the charged air in the forcefield is different from the surrounding air it would also cause the shockwave to be refracted .			0

@entity5 granted patent for device to shields vehicles against shockwaves
the device uses sensors to detect an explosion and anticipate blastwave
an ' arc generator ' uses lasers , microwaves or electric current to ionise the air in front of the shockwave so that it deflects and *reflects* the energy
the arc of ionised gas - or plasma - would also absorb shockwave energy
@entity5 says it can protect tanks , buildings , ships , aircraft and submarines
