in the small @entity3 town of @entity4 , which sees up to 250 inches of snow annually , nearly all of the 218 residents live in one multi-story house			1
surrounded by only mountains and the sea , the remote town is so isolated that it 's only accessible by @entity11 's longest one way tunnel , which stretches for two and a half miles			1
but the tunnel , which alternates directions every half an hour , closes at 11pm until re-opening at 5:30 the following morning			0
the local church performs baptisms in an inflatable pool in the basement and children can easily knock on their teacher 's door for homework help in the evenings			0
filmmaker , @entity39 , a fellow @entity3 from @entity40 , was one of the first to take interest in the peculiar small town and its unusual daily realities			1
she said : ' this community has always been of interest due to its primary place of residence being one tower - the @entity20			2
the building , the @entity20 , houses the entire neighbourhood , including convenience stores and a school a filmmaker from @entity40 , @entity3 , has recently taken interest in developing a project about the town the building was first constructed by the @entity59 in the 1950s , but is now under civilian ownership it is only accessible by a two - and - a - half mile , one - way tunnel , which alternates directions during the day what makes the town so fascinating is that despite the geographical isolation , families have continual contact ' there is so much geographic isolation yet continual contact via this living set up			1
' the residents work for the port , as boat mechanics , or in the city or occasionally drive out to work outside the community			0
' there are a few rebels to this particular living arrangement , however , such as @entity81 , who has opted to live in his ' immobile ' motor home			0
most residents work for the port , as boat mechanics , but a few do drive out to work outside the community in the brutal winters , the town may see up to 250 inches of snowfall , but in the summer , it 's another story in the summer , the city sees up to 22 hours of sun a day and about 900,000 tourists who visit via cruise ships it has long been of interest as a filming location , though recent enquiries are focused on a reality show one of the rebels to this particular living arrangement is @entity81 , who resides in an ' immobile ' mobile home although the town remains quite sleepy during the brutal winter months , in the summer , it 's a completely different story			2
as many as 900,000 tourists pass through the town from cruise ships during the warmer months , when the town enjoys up to 22 hours of sunlight			0
the creation of the 14 - story building began in 1953 by the @entity59 , but came into civilian ownership a few years later when the @entity59 left the town			1
although in the past , the town has been the subject of interest for a big budget film , recent requests have centred more on the potential for a reality show or real - life @entity123 .			0

in this small @entity3 town , almost all 218 residents live in the same place
