now they are only be able to reclaim £ 250 due to a clause in their travel insurance policy			1
mrs @entity59 , an @entity73 therapist said : ' it was bad enough that the money went missing from the safety deposit box but to then charge us for using it was bare faced cheek			1
' we were left with just a few rupees worth around ten pence and we had to ring home to unlock our credit cards to see us through			0
on arrival at the hotel the couple were advised to store their valuables in a locker located at the reception ' the terrible thing was people were trying to make out that no money went missing at all			1
' @entity3 used to be a special place and we got married there but i would never go back now			2
' the couple were holidaying with friends when trouble occurred on the fourth day of last month 's trip			2
there were no @entity28 camera in the secure locker room mrs @entity59 whose husband works as a mechanical engineer said : ' the hotel and @entity68 themselves suggested we did not keep valuables in the room and instead use the locker at reception and we assumed that was good advice			1
' the money was kept in two wallets inside the locked deposit box along with a watch and four passports and the idea was to get small amounts of money every few days			1
it was a total shock to see the cash had gone			0
' the safety deposit box was not tampered with and the lock was still intact as was left accordingly			1
both wallets had even left zipped up as we left them			0
the only items not missing were our passports , watch and credit cards			0
' we alerted the hotel and the police but we could n't believe it when we heard there was no cctv cameras in the area of the safety deposit boxes			1
the manager said there were no cameras in the safety deposit box room because he did not want guest to complain about invasion of privacy			1
' it is pretty obvious what happened but they would n't accept responsibility for what happened to us			0
the manager said that the money would have been taken during the night because there were too many people around during the day and he went about calling the night receptionist and night porter to attend the police station for questioning			0
the police said the money was most likely stolen by a duplicate key			1
' a holiday rep from @entity68 logged a complaint but warned the @entity162 hotel staff doubted their allegations a rogue employee had taken the missing money			2
the group later moved to the nearby @entity167 in @entity168			0
the couple had previously got married in @entity3 , but have said they would never return after the experience mrs @entity59 said her holiday was ' ruined ' and she spent the whole break ' crying ' as a result of the theft mrs @entity59 said : ' it was being implied we had stolen our own money or that the money was never in the safety deposit box to begin with			1
we were extremely distressed by what she was saying			0
' we felt alone and unsupported from the hotel management and @entity184 's reps			0
we just felt we could no longer stay at the hotel and the manager stated ' it was probably for the best we did n't stay at the hotel			0
' nothing was done to help us other than us requesting to move hotel to a lower star rating than we had paid for			0
lots of distress and upset was caused and we only had enough money to buy food and drink after the theft			2
' our money was stolen whilst it was in possession of the hotel and they had the timerity to charged us for it			2
this holiday was nothing short of a nightmare and we felt very much alone and isolated			0
i could n't even tell my parents about it			0
all i did that holiday was cry			0
' a report by the @entity214 police said : ' the unknown employee ie : receptionist and room boy of @entity47 committed theft of 2000 pounds from the safe locker by using duplicate key			1
' a spokesman for @entity68 said : ' @entity184 is sorry to hear of the group 's complaint			0
as soon as we were made aware of their reported loss our holiday advisors in resort did everything that they could to assist , including helping them to secure a police report for their insurance claim			2
' we would like to reassure customers that incidents of this type are extremely rare and also take the opportunity to remind customers of the importance of taking out a travel insurance policy when booking their holiday			2
